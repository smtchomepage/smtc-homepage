Various organic/inorganic model foulants such as sodium alginate, bovine serum albumin (BSA) and silica nanoparticles were applied to polyamide-polyethersulfone FO hollow fiber membranes fabricated in our laboratory. In order to understand all possible interactions, experiments were performed with a single foulant as well as combinations of foulants. Experimental results suggested that the degree of FO membrane fouling could be promoted by synergistic effect of organic foulants, the presence of divalent cations, low cross-flow velocity and high permeation drag force. The water flux of fouled FO hollow fibers could be fully restored by simple physical cleaning. It was also found that hydrodynamic regime played an important role in combined organic–inorganic fouling of FO membranes.},

This concept is enabled by the design and preparation of thermally responsive hydrogels having a semi-interpenetrating network (semi-IPN) structure. Thermally responsive semi-IPN hydrogels were synthesized by polymerization of N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAm) in the presence of polysodium acrylate (PSA) or polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Their functions as draw agents in FO were systematically studied and compared with hydrogels prepared from the PNIPAm homopolymer or the NIPAM-SA copolymer. While the semi-IPN hydrogels displayed the desirable balanced thermally responsive swelling and dewatering behavior, the NIPAm-SA copolymer hydrogels were found to have poor dewatering behavior, making them unsuitable for a continuous temperature driven desalination process. At 40 °C, the semi-IPN hydrogels rapidly release nearly 100\% of the water absorbed during the FO drawing process carried out at room temperature. Results clearly indicate the potential of semi-IPN hydrogels as semi-solid draw agents in the FO process, in which quasi-continuous desalination could be achieved by cyclic heating and cooling within a moderate temperature change.},

	title = {Membrane distillation crystallization-performance enhancement and scaling control},
	abstract = {Membrane distillation (MD) is well recognized as a potential alternative technology
for desalination due to the benefits of moderate operating temperatures, low
sensitivity to feed salinity, high salt rejection and ability to incorporate free lowgrade
heat. However, technical challenges that impede the industrialization of MD
brine processing still remain, which include the temperature polarization effect and
fouling/scaling formation, especially at high salt concentration, etc.
This thesis provides a comprehensive review on the state-of-art of MD operations in
concentrated solutions, focusing on some areas that need to be further investigated
or improved, such as available methods for performance enhancement and scaling
control in membrane processes, investigation and measurement of membrane
fouling/scaling, the coupled processes of membrane and crystallization operations,
which may provide strategies to address the above challenges.
Firstly, the potential of introducing gas bubbling has been preliminary explored to
improve fluid dynamics and shear stress in the shell side of the DCMD module. The
effect of operating conditions and module configuration on the flux enhancement
ratio induced by gas bubbling were investigated in a low concentration (3.5\%)
DCMD. Additionally, the module performance and scaling status for high salt
concentrations (from 18\% to supersaturation) have been examined and compared in
three systems (i.e., modified module with knitted-spacers, original modules with
and without bubbling). It was found that the introduction of gas bubbling not only
mitigates the temperature polarization effect but also enhances surface shear stress
intensity to postpone scaling formation on the membrane surface.
Secondly, a more in-depth theoretical analysis on the working mechanisms of gas
bubbling was studied, with the aid of direct observation and statistical analysis on
the bubble characteristics. The results showed that bubbles with small mean size
and narrow size distribution were preferred for creating even flow distribution,
intensifying mixing and enhancing surface shear stress. Compared to that of a nonbubbling DCMD system, the values of heat transfer coefficient and temperature
polarization coefficient (TPC) reached up to 2.30- and 2.13-fold, respectively, at an
optimal gas flowrate. Additionally, with the theoretical expressions for scaling
resistance derived based on resistance-in-series model, it was found that gas
bubbling can remarkably decrease scaling resistance, due to the high shear stress
induced by the flowing water and gas bubbles.
Thirdly, fundamentally, in order to prevent scaling formation and prolong
membrane lifespan, a novel method was proposed to quantify the scaling formation
in DCMD brine concentration processes, based on crystal kinetics on the membrane
surface and transfer mechanisms of MD. A mathematical model, namely,
crystallization on membrane surface (COMS), was developed and verified in terms
of MD performance (critical point of major flux decline and scaling formation) and
deposited crystal characteristics (median size and total number). The results
indicated that the critical point can be estimated precisely based on COMS model
and the scaling information can be quantified effectively by crystallization kinetics.
A good agreement with an acceptable average absolute relative error of 10\%
between the experimental and simulated data confirms the reliability of this
proposed COMS model.Fourthly, a hybrid process that integrates MD with crystallization, namely
continuous membrane distillation crystallization (CMDC), was systematically
studied with a highly concentrated NaCl feed solution (26.7 wt\% salt). In order to
improve the product recovery (pure water and NaCl crystal) and better realize zero
discharge, an orthogonal fractional factorial (OFF) experiment design was used to
optimize the operating conditions. The range analysis of the experimental results
identified the feed and permeate-side flow rates as the most influential factors
affecting CMDC performance. Additionally, the optimal operating parameters
determined from the analysis were validated experimentally, which confirmed the
merits of the OFF experiment design and analysis for the CMDC process.},

When operated at a constant flux, biofilm formation on the RO membrane resulted in a slow rise in transmembrane pressure (TMP) of 22\% for the initial four days of operation, followed by a sharp increase of 159\% over the following two days. The initial slow increase in TMP was probably due to the formation of a biofilm on the membrane surface, which then accelerated the rate of biofouling through the effect of concentration polarization. At later stages of operation, most of the bacterial biomass consisted of dead cells. The amount of extracellular polymeric substances appeared to correlate positively with the number of dead cells. The results indicate that prolonging the initial stage of slow TMP increase and avoiding the latter stage of accelerated TMP increase would provide a sustainable operation of the RO system. These results suggest that nutrient limitation could reduce biofilm accumulation and delay the increase in TMP.},

	url = {http://repository.ntu.edu.sg/handle/10356/53886},
	abstract = {With rapid development of industrialization and fast expansion in global population, there is an increasing need for sustainable energy and clean water resources. Energy crisis has become a global issue and limited access to clean water is now a great challenge for many people around the world. Osmotic process has become an attractive solution for these problems as it develops very fast in a broad variety of applications including desalination (using Forward Osmosis (FO)) and energy generation (using Pressure Retarded Osmosis (PRO)) though FO/PRO still faces many challenges. This report will firstly review the development and challenges of FO/PRO membranes and then describe the basic steps of fabrication, modifications and evaluation of PRO membranes. The main purpose of the project is to develop a thin-film composite (TFC) hollow fiber (HF) membrane that is suitable for PRO operation and conduct a series of characterization on the newly developed membrane. Polyetherimide (PEI) is selected to fabricate the membrane substrate as it has higher tensile modulus than polyether sulfone (PES), which is a common used material in current hollow fiber membrane fabrication. Interfacial polymerization technique is applied to make the selective layer on the membrane substrate.

The result shows that the HF membrane is able to withstand pressure as high as 15 bars in PRO mode and produce a power density of 10.63 W/m2. The substrate is mechanically tough and has large pure water permeability (PWP) of 462.4 L m-2 h-1 bar-1. After interfacial polymerization, the TFC HF membrane has PWP of 2.01 L m-2 h-1 bar-1 and solute permeability of 0.525 L m-2 h-1. This implies low selectivity of the membrane, which may be caused by uneven pore distribution. A further improvement is needed to achieve excellent performance for PRO operation.},

This study provided an insight into the interplay between critical flux, concentration polarization or CP (through the enhanced osmotic pressure effect) and fouling. In colloidal fouling, critical flux determined the deposition of particles on the membrane surface. The build up of deposit layer caused an additional hydraulic resistance as well as the cake enhanced osmotic pressure (CEOP) effect, which could be the predominant contributor in the membrane performance loss. Whereas in biofouling, it was postulated that the role of CP was to control the level of nutrient for the growth of biofilm, which in turn caused the biofilm enhanced osmotic pressure (BEOP) phenomenon.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the determination of critical flux and the cake enhanced osmotic pressure (CEOP) effect of colloidal silica fouling in reverse osmosis (RO) using a sodium chloride tracer response technique. The tracer technique gave the transient values of concentration polarization, CP, and cake resistance, Rf. From these values, the rate of accumulation of deposit, dmf/dt, could be readily determined. The critical flux, Jcrit, was defined as the flux at which the rate of deposition of colloidal silica on the membrane, became zero, i.e. dmf/dt = 0. It was found that the critical flux concept was applicable to colloidal silica fouling in the RO process. The critical flux was strongly influenced by the crossflow velocity, such that J crit ∼ v 0.4 . In addition, the critical Peclet number, (Jv/km)crit, which is a measure of the convective to diffusive forces, to trigger silica fouling was approximately 0.52. Furthermore, it was observed that the amount of particles convected to and finally deposited on the membrane surface, known as the fractional deposition constant, Φ, was strongly influenced by the crossflow velocity. At low crossflow (\&lt;0.1 m s−1, shear rate \&lt;430 s−1) Φ = 1.0, but at 0.22 m s−1 (shear rate = 940 s−1) Φ dropped to about 0.1. The CEOP effect, as deduced from the transient CP data, was found to be more severe at high flux and low crossflow velocity conditions, due to formation of a thicker cake layer and flux-induced polarization. Even for the small (20 nm) colloids used in this study, the CEOP effect can readily exceed the Rf effect due to fouling.},

	title = {Preparation, characterization and optimization of thin-film composite hollow fiber membranes for osmotically driven membrane processes.},
	abstract = {Osmosis or forward osmosis (FO) is a natural process for water transfer through a semi-permeable membrane under an osmotic pressure gradient across the membrane. Recently there has been a renewed interest in osmotically driven membrane processes (ODMPs) as a potential means of desalination, dewatering and power generation in pressure retarded osmosis (PRO). The renewed interest comes from their potential to either reduce energy consumption or produce energy (by PRO). 

First of all, a novel thin-film composite (TFC) hollow fiber membrane has been fabricated by interfacial polymerization on the inner surface of a polyethersulfone (PES) hollow fiber. We describe the characteristics and potential applications of the newly developed FO hollow fiber membrane. This FO membrane presents excellent intrinsic separation properties, with a water flux of 42.6 L/m2•h using 0.5 M NaCl as the draw solution and DI water as the feed with the active layer facing the draw solution orientation at 23 °C. The corresponding ratio of salt flux to water flux was only 0.094 g/L. To evaluate different application scenarios, various NaCl solutions (500 ppm (8.6 mM), 1wt\% (0.17 M) and 3.5wt\% (0.59 M)) were used as the feed water to test the performance of the FO membrane. The membrane can achieve a water flux of 12.4 L/m2•h with 3.5 wt\% NaCl solution as the feed and 2 M NaCl as the draw solution, respectively, suggesting it has good potential for seawater desalination.

Further, a specially designed PRO hollow fiber membrane has been successfully developed and applied in the PRO process to demonstrate its potential for power generation. The membrane fabrication method is similar to that used for making TFC FO hollow fiber membranes, but further optimization and improvement have led to a new type of TFC hollow fiber membranes with much stronger mechanical strength in addition to its excellent separation property and high water flux. A power density as high as 10.6 W/m2 can be achieved using seawater brine (1.0 M NaCl) and wastewater brine (40 mM NaCl), which suggests that the newly developed PRO hollow fiber membrane has great potential to be applied in PRO processes to harvest salinity gradient energy. A higher pressure is preferred as it allows generation of higher power density (pressures of 12 bar may be optimal for seawater as the high salinity stream), and this can be realized by reduced fiber dimension.

Moreover, we have developed a novel hollow fiber membrane by balancing these competing factors based on our prior experience in TFC membranes. The newly developed TFC hollow fiber membrane can achieve a power density of 20.9 W/m2 at a pressure of 15 bar, using synthetic seawater brine (1.0 M NaCl) as the draw solution and synthetic river water (1 mM NaCl) as the feed water, respectively. The simultaneous specific reverse salt flux was found to be 0.03 mole/L, which is much lower than reported flat-sheet membranes, as the self-supported hollow fiber membrane can eliminate the deformation-enhanced reverse salt diffusion that is typical for flat-sheet membranes. However it was observed that the water permeability and structure parameter of the TFC hollow fiber membrane varied noticeably corresponding to the change in the hydraulic pressure imposed in the fiber lumen. Over a certain range ({\textless}15 bar), such variations proved to have positive impacts, facilitating the water permeation and reducing the ICP in the PRO process.

Finally, a theoretical model is developed to understand the ICP for hollow fiber membranes more deeply. The ICP is unique in ODMPs, and is believed to associate with the thickness, porosity and tortuosity of the flat-sheet membrane, but the situation of hollow fiber membrane is somehow more complicated. Based on the newly developed model, the geometry parameter of hollow fiber membranes is found to impact the ICP, and the argument on the membrane configurations including inner and outer location of the active layer is conducted. Moreover, the external concentration polarization (ECP) in the lumen of hollow membranes is found to relate to inner diameter, membrane module length and cross flow hydrodynamics by theoretical calculation. However, the gain in membrane performance may be accompanied by the loss in energy efficiency, which is the limiting factor behind the optimization. Based on these findings, this work provides a comprehensive insight on tailoring hollow fiber membranes in ODMPs for better performance and higher energy efficiency.},

However, there is currently a lack of a suitable FO membrane that can achieve the same amount of water flux as commercially available reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. Poly (amide–imide) (PAI) hollow fiber membranes with a nano-filtration (NF)-like skin have been developed by the means of simple chemical modifications with polyethyleneimine (PEI) and poly (styrene sulfonate) (PSS) to form positively and negatively charged selective layer respectively. PAI hollow fiber membranes were characterized before and after chemical modification in terms of pure water permeability, molecular weight cut off and salt rejection with MgCl2 and Na2SO4. Hollow fibers presenting high water flux and salt rejection were put to a lab-scale FO filtration setup and its volumetric water flux, JV and corresponding salt flux, JS were measured. FTIR spectroscopy, zeta potential and scanning electron microscope were used to verify the various chemical modifications of the hollow fiber membrane samples.},

	url = {http://repository.ntu.edu.sg/handle/10356/53527},
	abstract = {In nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) processes, membranes are prone to biofouling and need to be cleaned periodically using oxidizing biocides, including the most widely used chlorine in different forms. The polyamide-based (PA) separation layer of thin film composite (TFC) membranes can be modified or degraded during contact with those agents. Understanding the effects of chlorine exposure on PA membranes is essential to improving the life span of membranes from both manufacturing and operation perspectives. This research presents a systematic investigation of the effects of chlorine exposure on the physiochemical properties and performance of PA membranes. 
To study the degradation of PA NF and RO membranes by sodium hypochlorite, six coated and uncoated fully aromatic (FA) and piperazine (PIP) semi-aromatic PA membranes were treated with hypochlorite solution and analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy. XPS results showed that in chlorine treated FA PA membranes the ratio of bound chlorine to surface nitrogen was 1:1 whereas it was only 1:6 in the case of PIP PA membranes. The surface oxygen of uncoated FA and PIP membranes increased with increasing hypochlorite concentration whereas it decreased for coated FA membranes. High resolution XPS data supported that chlorination increased the number of carboxylic groups on the PA surface, which appeared to form by hydrolysis of the amide bonds (C(O)–N). FTIR data indicated the disappearance of the amide II band (1541 cm-1) and aromatic amide peak (1609 cm-1) in both coated and uncoated chlorinated FA membranes, consistent with the N-chlorination suggested by the XPS results. Furthermore, the surface charge of the chlorinated membranes at low pH ({\textless} 6) became negative, consistent with amide-nitrogen chlorination. Chlorination appeared to either increase or decrease membrane hydrophobicity depending on the chlorination exposure conditions, which implied that N-chlorination and hydrolysis may be competing processes. The effects of property changes on the performance were also observed for the NF90, BW30 and NF270 membranes.
Detailed appraisal of NF and RO membrane performance due to chlorine treatment was carried out by exposing three PA-TFC membranes (NF90, BW30 and NF270) to different concentrations of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) at pH 5 for 24 h. The elemental composition obtained from XPS showed that the chlorine content in the PA layer increased with the chlorine concentration. Treatment of membranes with 10 ppm Cl increased the membrane hydrophilicity. In contrast, when treated with 1000 ppm Cl or more, the membranes became less hydrophilic. Water permeability values for all three membrane types declined with increased chlorine concentrations. Filtration of polyethylene glycols (PEGs) with molecular weights of 200, 400 and 600 Daltons (Da) was performed to investigate the influence of chlorine treatment on the membrane molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) and rejection by size exclusion. Treatment with 10 and 100 ppm Cl lowered the MWCO while treatment with higher concentrations increased the MWCO. All chlorinated membranes experienced higher NaCl rejection compared to the virgin ones. The performance of NF90 was tested with respect to the rejection of inorganic contaminants including boric acid (H3BO3) and arsenic (H2AsO4-). The boron rejection results paralleled the PEG rejection, whereas those for arsenic followed the NaCl rejection patterns. The changes in membrane performance due to chlorine treatment were explained in terms of competing mechanisms: membrane tightening, bond cleavage by N-chlorination and chlorination promoted polyamide hydrolysis.
The effects of chlorine exposure conditions on the physiochemical properties and performance of a polyamide membrane were studied by treating an NF90 membrane with sodium hypochlorite at different concentrations, pH and duration. The changes in membrane elemental composition and bonding chemistry obtained from XPS and ATR-FTIR revealed the impacts of two competing mechanisms: N-chlorination and chlorination promoted hydrolysis. More chlorine was incorporated into the PA matrix at pH {\textless} 7, at which HOCl is dominant; while chlorine promoted hydrolysis was more favorable at pH {\textgreater} 7 with an abundance of hydroxyl groups. The membrane surface became more hydrophobic when chlorination was dominant, which in turn caused the water permeability of the chlorinated membrane to decrease. Meanwhile, the membrane became more hydrophilic and less cross-linked when hydrolysis effects were governing, which made the membrane more permeable for water. Rejection of charged solutes (NaCl, As(V)) improved under most chlorinating conditions due to increased charge density. However, when hydrolysis was severe (≥ 1000 ppm, pH 7 and 9), the enhanced charge repulsion effect could not compensate for the extensive amide bond cleavage, resulting in decreased rejection. The lower rejection of neutral boric acid provided strong evidence of a less cross-linked separation layer.},

	title = {Development of novel composite nanofiltration hollow fiber membranes for niche applications},
	abstract = {Due to its unique ability to separate divalent and multivalent ions as well as low molecular weight organic species, nanofiltration (NF) has now become a widely applied separation technology. However, it is challenging to develop NF membranes that remain competent permeation flux at ultrafiltration (UF)-range low operating pressure to reduce energy consumption and membrane fouling tendency. 

This thesis presents the development of novel composite hollow fiber membranes with NF-like selectivity at low operating pressure, and tailored surface properties and structures for various niche applications including water softening and forward osmosis (FO). Novel composite NF hollow fiber membrane for low-pressure water softening were prepared via interfacial polymerization (IP), and the IP thin film formation process was ameliorated to strengthen the capability for softening of more concentrated and complex water sources. Moreover, novel double-skinned hollow fibers with an NF-like secondary selective skin were produced through either surface modification or layer-by-layer assembly method to mitigate the internal concentration polarization, scale formation and organic fouling for practical FO applications.},

	abstract = {Forward osmosis (FO) has received intensive studies recently for a range of potential applications such as wastewater treatment, water purification and seawater desalination. One of the major challenges to be overcome is the lack of an optimized FO membrane that can produce a high water flux comparable to commercial reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. The objective of the project is to fabricate thin film composite (TFC) hollow fiber membranes which are suitable for FO applications.

Specifically, the ultra-filtration hollow fiber substrate was spun using polyethersulfone (PES) by phase inversion method. The substrate is single-skinned on the lumen side. The thin film active layer was formed on the inner surface of the hollow fiber substrate through interfacial polymerization (IP). The two monomers of the polymerization used are M-phenylene-diamine (MPD) and M-phenylene-diamine (TMC). Several IP experimental variables including involvement of additives, MPD concentration in the aqueous solution, polymerization reaction time, etc. were optimized. Hollow fiber substrates and FO membranes were characterized using different analytical methods including scanning electron microscope observation, molecular weight cut-off test, porosity measurement and mechanical strength test, etc. Water and solute permeability of the FO membrane were also measured in an RO setup.

It was found that two different chemicals can successfully work together as the additives of aqueous solution to achieve a better performing membrane than applying each additive separately. It was also deduced that, within a feasible range, higher MPD concentration in the aqueous solution is considered more desirable in FO hollow fiber membrane fabrication. The water flux achieved during lab-scale FO test for two membrane orientations using different draw solution concentrations were benchmarked against commercial FO and nanofiltration (NF) membranes. For the fabricated membranes with optimized preparation conditions, water flux can reach 42.6 L/h•m2 using 0.5M NaCl as draw solution and deionized water as feed for the active layer facing draw solution orientation. The performance of the in-house made FO hollow fiber is believed to be superior to all FO membranes reported in the open literature.},

Four batches of experiments were conducted, with the addition of different additives to the base casting solutions and comparisons were made between blend membranes and membranes without additives. The influence of additives, nano-sized TiO2 particles both with and without modification, and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), to the base casting solutions as well as prepared membrane thickness on the morphologies, physical properties as well as membrane performance were investigated. The prepared UF membranes were characterized through several analytical methods, namely, viscosity measurements, scanning electron microscope (SEM) observations, contact angle measurements and permeability tests. Results suggested that UF membrane properties were improved by the additives. Particularly, due to PVP’s hydrophilic nature, the surface of blend membranes were much more hydrophilic than membranes with only pure PS contents. The PS membranes blend with 2 wt.\% modified TiO2 and 3 wt.\% PVP showed the largest porosity and the highest flux among four batches.},

However, the efficiency of FO processes is significantly limited by internal concentration polarization (ICP), which is difficult to detect by conventional characterization methods. In this work, we aimed to apply electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to FO systems, and to develop a methodology for interpreting the interplay between the membrane structure and the polarization phenomena. Three commercial FO membranes with different substrate structures were characterized by an EIS system that was modified to accommodate FO processes, and the impedance spectra were analyzed based on their equivalent circuits. In the static tests (without osmosis), the limit behaviors of the impedance spectra were exploited to resolve the structural information of the FO membranes from the electrolyte background, which was in turn compared with the characterization results via scanning electron microscope (SEM). Associated with the different membrane orientations, the dynamic tests (with osmosis) were implemented to verify the ability of the EIS system to detect the variation of the developed concentration profiles within the membrane structure. The characterization results indicate that EIS is promising to be a handy tool to investigate the polarization phenomena during the FO processes.},

In addition, the hydrophilicity and microporous nature of a fouling layer can affect the driving force and correspondingly the flux in MD via curvature effects on the vapor pressure as described by the Kelvin equation. This study explores the effect of the hydrophilicity of the sludge on the particle size, vapor pressure and pore-size distribution (PSD) in the biofouling layer and on the permeation flux in cross-flow MD. Two sets of hydrophilic sludge cultures were selected via the Microbial-Adhesion-to-Hydrocarbon method. Cross-flow MD experiments conducted with these two sludges displayed a 60\% reduction in the flux relative to using a Milli-Q water feed. However, there was no significant difference in the fluxes for the two sludges. Characterization of the pore-size distribution of the two sludges using evapoporometry, a novel technique based on the vapor-pressure depression caused by small pores, indicated a vapor-pressure depression of 31\% and 21\% for the more- and less-hydrophilic sludges, respectively. However the effect of the 10\% difference in vapor-pressure depression, when combined with the effect of the biofouling layer on the heat- and mass-transfer resistances, could not be detected within the experimental error in this study. Nevertheless, a major conclusion is that the vapor-pressure depression caused by a biofouling layer, or other foulants, could cause a significant reduction in the driving force for MD.},

Flux performance and foulant deposition on membranes were systematically investigated for a submerged membrane system. When an initial flux of 25 L/m2h was applied, both flux reduction and foulant mass deposition were severe for feed water containing the mixture of LYS and ALG (e.g., 50\% LYS and 50\% ALG at a total foulant concentration of 100 mg/L). In comparison, fouling was much milder for feed water containing either LYS or ALG alone. Compared to the CTA FO membrane, the TFC FO membrane showed greater fouling propensity under mild FO fouling conditions due to its much rougher surface. Nevertheless, under severe FO fouling conditions, fouling was dominated by foulant-deposited-foulant interaction and membrane surface properties played a less important role. Furthermore, when the feed water contained both LYS and ALG in sufficient amount, the deposited cake layer foulant composition (i.e., the LYS/ALG mass ratio) was not strongly affected by membrane types (CTA versus TFC) nor testing modes (pressure-driven NF mode versus osmosis-driven FO mode). In contrast, solution chemistry such as pH and calcium concentration had remarkable effect on the cake layer composition due to their effects on foulant–foulant interaction.},

Compared to the benchmark single module system, which showed drastically deteriorating membrane performance with increasing membrane area, the multi-element DCMD system with modules in parallel matrix was found to perform better with water production improved slightly but specific power consumption (SPC) greatly reduced down to 0.5\% of the single module system. The optimal matrix was obtained at module number of eight for a 20m2 module due to trade-off relationship between module specifications and effective process driving force in MD. Supported by theoretical analysis, it was found that the matrix array pattern had no influence on the performance of the multi-subsystem DCMD train. Further investigation showed that an 18-subsystem MD train with a membrane area of 200m2 achieved a 16 times water production rate with only 10\% of the SPC, as compared to that of single system with the same membrane area.},

It was found that stable water production under elevated mixed liquor concentration could be achieved. The OMBR achieved organic removal and pharmaceutical removal in excess of 99\% and 96\%, respectively. However, the biological process was critical to the overall performance of the OMBR. Salt accumulation and flux performance are key issues for OMBR, whereby membrane fouling plays a significant role, such that mild fouling may have ameliorating effects, whereas severe fouling may have aggravating effects. New methods of assessing OMBR performance were developed. Experiments verified that the OMBR could achieve stable flux and good product quality at recovery up to 95.8\% with flux efficiency factor ≥ 0.8. The study substantiated that the OMBR is a potential technology for water reclamation. However, there are important performance-affecting factors that need to be further researched.},

	title = {Preparation of novel polyvinylidene fluoride ({PVDF}) hollow fiber membranes via thermally induced phase separation},
	abstract = {Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) has been attached great importance as a membrane material in recent years. With outstanding properties of high mechanical strength, thermal stability, chemical resistance and hydrophobicity, PVDF and copolymers have been widely employed to fabricate hollow fiber membranes, especially with the development of thermally induced phase separation (TIPS) method. Therefore, a better understanding of the factors associated
with TIPS process is required to produce high flux PVDF membranes with strong mechanical properties.
PVDF hollow fiber membranes were prepared from a series of dope compositions under determined spinning conditions via TIPS technique. Several variables including initial polymer concentration, involvement of PTFE as additive, quenching temperature were studied respectively in each batch of experiment. The fabricated membranes were characterized using different analytical methods comprising scanning electron microscope observation, porosity measurement, mechanical strength test and pure water permeability (PWP) test, etc.
The newly developed PVDF hollow fiber membrane can achieve a PWP of 537 LMH with a reinforced mechanical strength (tensile modulus) of 102.2 MPa and a mean pore size below 0.1 μm. Spherulic structures were observed in all membranes suggesting that the solid-liquid separation was the dominant process. It was found that under the PVDF/DMP system, mechanical strength of the membranes obviously increased with the increase of molecular weight of the PVDF polymer or its concentration in the dope solution, which was reflected under SEM observation with denser outer and inner surfaces. When adding PTFE into the
dope solution, the water permeability could be drastically enhanced in the PVDF/DMP system. The cooling rate controlled by the air gap and quenching temperature also played an important role in determining the micro-structure and consequently the performance of resultant membranes. The results presenting in this project would be valuable references in the fabrication of PVDF hollow fiber membrane via TIPS for optimized membrane properties.},

	abstract = {In this study, we examine the improvement of fouling control of hollow fibre membranes with mechanical vibrations in the dead-end filtration of an inorganic suspension. Hollow fibres with diameters of 1.7 mm and 2 mm vibrating at moderate frequencies (0–15 Hz) and small amplitudes (0–12 mm) were submerged vertically in a 4 g/L Bentonite solution. Experiments were then conducted at both constant permeate flux and constant suction pressure conditions. The results showed that the membrane performance can be greatly improved when the vibration frequency or the vibration amplitude increases beyond a threshold magnitude. For example, over 90\% reduction in the membrane fouling rate was achieved at 8 mm amplitude and 8 Hz frequency vibration compared to no vibration. Experiments were also conducted with 1\% and 2\% fibre looseness. The results showed that a small looseness can reduce the membrane fouling and increase the permeate flux under vibrations, which can be mainly attributed to the additional lateral movement of the fibres induced by the looseness. A comparison of vibrating the hollow fibres with and without the holding frame was also carried out to determine the effects of turbulence generated by the vibrating holding frame used in the experimental setup. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements were performed to quantify the associated turbulence inside the membrane reactors. It was confirmed that the turbulence generated by the vibrating frame was more obvious at a high vibration frequency. However, it had little influence on the membrane filtration performance. Overall, the results from the present study confirm that at moderate frequencies, the cake layer resistance can be reduced substantially by vibration due to the dynamic shear enhancement on the membrane surface.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a novel concept for a hybrid desalination system that combines reverse electrodialysis (RED) and reverse osmosis (RO) processes. In this hybrid process the RED unit harvests the energy in the form of electricity from the salinity gradient between a highly concentrated solution (e.g., seawater or concentrated brine) and a low salinity solution (e.g., biologically treated secondary effluent or impaired water). The RED-treated high salinity solution has a lower salt concentration and serves as the feed solution for the RO unit to reduce the pump work. The concentrated RO brine provides the RED unit a better high salinity source for the energy recovery compared to seawater. In addition, the concentration of the discharged brine can be controlled by the RED unit for improving the water recovery and minimizing the impact on the environment. Different configurations of the hybrid RED–RO processes are presented for a comparative study on the basis of mathematical modeling. Specifically, various operating conditions for the RED unit are investigated for better adaptation to the hybrid system. The variations of the total specific energy consumption and the discharge brine concentration for various hybrid modes are simulated to verify the conceptual designs. The modeling results indicate that the RED–RO hybrid processes could substantially reduce the specific energy consumption and provide a better control of the discharge brine concentration in comparison to conventional seawater desalination RO processes.},

	title = {Development of aquaporin based biomimetic membranes for desalination applications},
	abstract = {Nature has contributed the best desalination material, aquaporin (AQP), for us. Attributed to its extremely high permeability for water molecules as well as high rejection to small solutes, in recent years there is a surge to mimic the natural cellular membranes by incorporating AQPs into various ultrathin films for water filtration applications. In this work, efforts are made to explore an effective way to design, prepare and evaluate highly permeable and selective AQP-based biomimetic membranes for water purification applications.

As a start, this thesis presents a comprehensive literature review on the AQPs and related AQP-based biomimetic membranes research. Basic information about AQPs, lipid and block copolymer systems is reviewed. Strategies for membrane protein reconstitution into lipid vesicles (liposomes) and polymer vesicles (polymersomes) are described. In addition, different types of AQP-based biomimetic membranes are reviewed and discussed in detail. Moreover, a series of characterization techniques commonly applied in protein/biomimetic membrane research are reviewed.

Equipped with fundamental knowledge and understanding of the state-of -the-art technology, a preliminary study was carried out to develop AQP-based biomimetic membranes. To make biomimetic membranes for water purification applications, preparing a defect-free platform for AQP incorporation on a suitable substrate is one of the critical steps. Two methods were used to prepare supported lipid membranes on a nanofiltration membrane surface under a benign pH condition of 7.8. One was direct vesicle fusion onto a hydrophilic membrane NF-270; the other was vesicle fusion facilitated by hydraulic pressure on a modified hydrophilic membrane NF-270, whose surface was spin-coated with positively charged lipids. Experiments revealed that the supported lipid membrane prepared by spin coating with vesicle fusion had a much lower defect density than that prepared by vesicle fusion only. It seems that the surface roughness and charge are main factors determining the quality of a supported lipid membrane. AQPs were successfully incorporated into 1, 2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) liposomes and its water permeability was examined by stopped-flow experiments. However, after the proteoliposomes were fused onto the modified substrate, the AQPs function in the resultant membrane was not observed. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images showed the presence of unfused proteoliposomes on the substrate. This may suggest that the presence of AQPs in the liposomes can significantly change the way that these vesicles interact with a surface.

In order to understand these problems that were encountered, different characterization techniques were employed to investigate the vesicle characteristics and the fusion behaviour of liposomes and proteoliposomes on solid surfaces. The results showed that after incorporation of aquaporin Z (AqpZ), the size and surface charge density of the proteoliposomes changed significantly compared with those of liposomes. Although the liposome could easily form a supported lipid bilayer on silica via vesicle rupture, it was much more difficult for proteoliposomes to fuse completely into bilayers on the same substrate. In addition, the fusion of proteoliposomes was further hindered after the density of incorporated AqpZ was increased, suggesting that the proteoliposomes with more proteins become more robust. However, both the liposome and proteoliposome had difficulty in fusing to supported lipid bilayers on the surface of a polyelectrolyte layer even though they carried an opposite charge, indicating that the polymer might play an important role in stabilizing the vesicles. It was also observed that a high concentration of AqpZ could be incorporated into the liposome even though its nominal permeability decreased.

Since it was difficult for proteoliposomes to fuse to bilayers completely because of the incorporated AQPs, we proposed a novel protocol to design an AQP-based membrane: the AqpZ incorporated proteoliposomes were immobilized in the inner surface of a hollow fibre membrane and subsequently encapsulated by a polyamide layer formed by interfacial polymerization, instead of being fused to bilayers. Different hollow fibre composite membranes with various lipid-to-AQP ratios were prepared and explored. The AQP-based hollow fibre composite membrane exhibited an increased water flux and salt rejection with an increase in the loading ratio of AQPs. The membrane with a high AQP-to-lipid ratio exhibited a 40 L•m-2•h-1•bar-1 flux at 5 bar, almost 200\% more than the flux of a commercial reverse osmosis membrane. This membrane also exhibited 500 ppm NaCl rejection above 97.5\%, which was also superior to the commercial membrane tested under the same conditions. The forward osmosis test of the AqpZ-based hollow fibre membrane also yielded a super high water flux. It showed that the most of introduced proteoliposomes were totally embedded in the polyamide layer, maintaining an intact spherical shape even after long-term pressure-driven filtration test. Series of experiments proved that it was the embedded AqpZ that enhanced the water flux and the integration between the embedded proteoliposomes and polyamide layer was entirely defect-free. It was evaluated that the AqpZ-incorporated hollow fibre composite membrane could cut the power consumption by up to 40\% in a Newater plant for wastewater treatment, if these hollow fibres were assembled in a standard 8-inch commercial membrane module (assuming a 80\% packing density, giving a 59 m2 membrane area). The use of AQP within membranes has been taken beyond the concept stage and offers a novel means for tailoring the membrane materials and improving the membrane performance.

Based on the previous work, a modified method was proposed to prepare a nanofiltration (NF) membrane based on AQPs. The proteoliposome, incorporated with AqpZ, was embedded into the selective layer through crosslinking of a polyelectrolyte with the membrane substrate made by poly(amide-imide) (PAI). The proteoliposome with mutants of AqpZ, which had a low water permeability, was selected as a control group. The water flux of the AqpZ-based membrane was around 50\% higher than the mutant one. At the optimal preparation conditions, the AqpZ-based membrane displayed a water flux of 36.6 L•m-2•h-1 with a MgCl2 rejection of 95\% at 1 bar. Results from our studies indicated that AqpZ could maintain a high water transport ability (about 250 µm/s for proteoliposomes with LPR 400) even at high temperature (70 °C for 2 hours) and keep its activity in the presence of highly charged polyelectrolytes (polyethyleneimine). These results and findings may provide useful insights for developing the next generation of biomimetic membranes.},

	abstract = {Membrane Distillation Crystallization (MDC) is an innovative approach which involves the integration of the Membrane Distillation (MD) process together with a crystallizer unit. By tapping onto the potentials of MD, it becomes possible to operate under a supersaturated state of the solution, thereby achieving the objective of zero discharge to the environment while recovering valuable salts. However, in the current literature, only a few studies provided limited coverage about the optimization of a continuous MDC process performance with regard to supersaturated solutions. Selecting proper operational conditions for process control is necessary, as there is a need to prevent membrane wetting and crystal crystallization within the membrane module due to concentration and temperature polarization effects. As such, the concept of fractional experimental design was introduced to determine the optimum operational parameters. Results from the analysis were verified experimentally, and it was deduced that a feed flow rate and temperature of 0.64 L/min and 338 K respectively, together with a permeate flow rate of 0.35 L/min and permeate temperature of 303 K, gave the highest production rates of pure water and sodium chloride crystals.

In addition, a runtime experiment lasting 21 hours was performed to determine its viability to be implemented on an industrial scale. Results showed the deterioration of the process performance and the quality of the permeate fluid worsening over time. Further analysis revealed that it was due to surface modifications on the membranes as a result of prolonged contact with high temperatures and a highly concentrated solution. Therefore, this implies the need for fabrication of membranes specially designed for continuous MDC processes operating in supersaturated solutions.},

Further, we demonstrated that the antimicrobial mechanism of pyocin S5 is membrane damage, evidenced by the leakage of intracellular materials, the increase of membrane permeability, and cell surface disruption.},

	title = {Development of novel layer-by-layer assembled nanofiltration hollow fiber membranes for water treatment},
	abstract = {Membrane technology has been studied extensively for water treatment over decades. The layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly method, which involves the build-up of polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) films on the surface or inside the pore structure of various membrane substrates, has shown great potential due to its extremely low thickness, highly controllable performance and simple procedures of formation. Therefore, this study aims to develop high performance hollow fiber membranes using the LBL assembly method for forward osmosis (FO) and water softening processes. In FO process, low concentration draw solution (less than 0.5M) was used to substantially reduce the draw solution (DS) replenishment, and the energy consumption for draw solution regeneration and separation. While in the water softening process, low operating pressure (less than 5bar) would be more suitable for hollow fiber membrane configuration with reduced energy consumption. 

With a solid understanding of the separation mechanisms of nanofiltration, a three-stage approach to develop the LBL assembled NF hollow fiber membrane has been adopted. At stage one, studies were conducted on the LBL deposition conditions to be applied on a polyethersulfone (PES) hollow fiber substrate. A simple deposition procedure by immersing the substrate into the polyanion poly(styrenesulfonic acid) (PSS) and polycation Poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) solutions alternately was used to achieve the desired number of deposition layers. With six layers of polyelectrolytes deposited, the membrane showed a high water flux of 40.5 l/m2 h with a low salt to water flux ratio, Js/Jv, of 0.201 g/L when using DI water as the feed and a 0.5 M MgCl2 solution as the draw solutions in the active layer facing draw solution (AL-facing-DS) orientation. In addition, 14.6 and 25.9 l/m2 h water fluxes with corresponding low Js/Jv ratios of 0.034 and 0.066 g/L can be achieved using 0.05 and 0.1 M draw solution concentrations, respectively, suggesting great potential of the LBL hollow fibers in the FO process.

It is proved that the inner surface modification may possess several advantages over the shell side for the hollow fiber substrate such as better protection of selective layer, enhanced homogeneity and controllability of the chemical modification and reduced chemical requirement. Therefore in the following study, inner skin deposited LBL (id-LBL) membranes were fabricated using a semi-dynamic process in which the solutions were introduced /replaced in the fiber lumen by syringes followed by static contact for a desired time. The newly developed id-LBL membranes were then tested in NF and FO applications and the performance were compared with outer surface deposition as well as some literature data. It was found that the id-LBL membranes could not only withstand higher operating pressure but also possess superior hardness rejection especially in high concentration mixed salt solutions (more than 95\% rejection to Mg2+ and Ca2+ in a 5000 ppm total dissolved salt (TDS) mixture under 4.8 bar). As for the FO process, of only two layer deposition, the id-LBL membranes also demonstrated significant performance improvement with increased water flux (up to 70 l/m2 h using 0.5 M MgCl2 as draw solution in AL-facing-DS configuration) and reduced salt leakage (around 0.5 g/m2 h using 1 M MgCl2 draw solution in AL-facing-FW configuration). It suggested that for hollow fiber substrate, the inner surface was also more suitable for the formation of the selective layer via LBL deposition than the outer surface.

However, it was found later that the rejection of id-LBL membranes was drastically deteriorated in the presence of SO42- in the feed water due to the weakened charge effect while the size exclusion was expected to play a more important role. Therefore, glutaraldehyde (GA) crosslinking was adopted in combination with modified LBL deposition conditions to develop a novel hollow fiber NF membrane with low-pressure water softening capability for synthesized hard water containing divalent counter ion SO42-. Based on the membrane characterization results, the possible structure of the deposited layers and the effect of GA crosslink were proposed. It was found that the crosslinking could tighten the membrane surface pores with increased hydrophilicity while the membrane surface charge was reduced. The crosslinked LBL membrane showed more than 10 l/m2.h.bar permeability with above 95\% rejection to each of 1,000 ppm MgCl2, MgSO4 and Na2SO4 solution under 2 bar pressure. It was also proven to be more suitable for the low-pressure water softening application at 2 bar in all tested feed water with the presence of SO42- and TDS up to 10,000 ppm in terms of both permeability and hardness removal efficiency when compared with commercial NF 270 and NF 90 membranes.

The future plans for this project are proposed in three directions: (1) to scale up the crosslinked LBL membrane with the best water softening performance for pilot study and possible commercialization; and (2) to explore the further applications of LBL hollow fiber membranes by modifying membrane properties such as surface pore size and charge density based on current PES substrate.; (3) to develop microfiltration (MF) hollow fiber substrate suitable for LBL deposition and explore the possible applications.},

	title = {Synthesis and characterization of silver nanocomposite nanofiltration and forward osmosis membranes based on layer-by-layer assembly},
	abstract = {Membrane separation processes, such as nanofiltration (NF) and forward osmosis (FO), have attained great attention and interests due to their various environmental applications including water and wastewater treatment, power generation, seawater desalination, food processing and pharmaceutical industry. However, membrane fouling, especially the irreversible membrane biofouling, remains a major drawback in prolonged membrane operation. The incorporation of bactericidal nanoparticles (NPs), for example silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), in membrane is considered as an effective approach to overcome above obstacle. Layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly method is a promising technique for fabricating different kinds of membranes with versatile structures. This study first investigated the stability and bactericidal activity of AgNPs in environmentally relevant freshwater matrices, and then focused on the development of antimicrobial silver nanocomposite NF and FO membranes based on LbL assembly. Effects of incorporation of AgNPs in membrane substrate on formation of LbL selective layer were also systematically studied. Performances of silver nanocomposite membranes were evaluated and compared with the AgNPs-free controls.

The influences of various natural organic matter (NOM) and chelating agent, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), on AgNPs stability (aggregation, dissolution) and bactericidal activity were investigated by comparing the particle size, surface zeta-potential, and bacterial viability, in terms of half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value, in environmentally relevant freshwater matrices. Bactericidal activity of AgNPs against Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli was not substantially affected with the presence of three model NOM, humic acid, bovine serum albumin and alginic acid, at concentration comparable to that of natural freshwaters. Nevertheless, the combined addition of Ca2+ and humic acid induced severe aggregation of AgNPs, resulting in a reduced nanotoxicity. The chelating agent, EDTA, exhibited a concentration-dependent effect on AgNPs bactericidal activity: at low concentration (1 mg/L), EDTA decreased toxicity of AgNPs likely by converting the relatively high toxic dissolved Ag species into a series of low toxic Ag-EDTA complex; at high concentrations (5 and 20 mg/L), EDTA mainly acted as a synergist and increased the toxicity of AgNPs probably by reacting with divalent cations (such as Ca2+ and Mg2+) on bacterial cell membranes. The results not only illustrate the influencing factors of AgNPs toxicity under natural freshwater conditions, but also benefit the understanding of nanotoxicity mechanisms as well as environmental impact assessments of nanomaterials.

Novel silver nanocomposite NF and FO membranes were first synthesized by adding the AgNPs in membrane selective layers based on LbL assembly. The incorporation of AgNPs in the membranes did not adversely affect the membrane separation performance in NF and FO processes at low AgNPs incorporation levels. The FO performance of the silver nanocomposite membranes was better than or comparable to most NF-like FO membranes reported in the literature. In addition, the silver nanocomposite NF and FO membranes exhibited excellent antibacterial properties against both Gram-positive B. subtilis and Gram-negative E. coli. The results showed that the performances of the silver nanocomposite LbL membranes with AgNPs in membrane selective layers are highly dependent on silver incorporation in the membranes, which could be controlled by using different membrane synthesis routines and doping of AgNPs.

Novel silver nanocomposite NF and FO membranes with enhanced water permeabilities and excellent antimicrobial properties were then fabricated by embedding the AgNPs in membrane substrates. The polyacrylonitrile silver nanocomposite membranes (PAN-Ag) were prepared using one-step phase inversion process and could be used as ultrafiltration (UF) membranes. With additional crosslinked layer-by-layer (xLbL) assembly on the UF substrates, xLbL-Ag nanocomposite membranes were obtained, which were applicable for both NF and FO operations. At the optimal concentration of AgNPs incorporation (0.02 wt.\%), water permeability of PAN-Ag(0.02) UF membrane increased by 14.3 \% compared with the AgNPs-free control; under the NF and FO testing conditions, corresponding water fluxes of NF/FO membrane increased by 10.1 \% and 24.4 \% respectively. In addition, the silver nanocomposite membranes exhibited excellent antibacterial performances. At the highest silver incorporation concentration of 0.10 wt.\%, xLbL3.0-Ag(0.10) nanocomposite NF/FO membrane led to {\textasciitilde}6 Log colony-forming units (CFU) reduction against Gram-positive B. subtilis and {\textasciitilde}5 Log CFU reduction against Gram-negative E. coli.},

The PSA/Ag cryogels combine the high porosity, excellent mechanical and water absorption properties of cryogels, and uniform dispersion of fine AgNPs on the cryogel pore surface for rapid disinfection with minimal Ag release ({\textless}100 ?g L?1). They were used in a process that employed their ability to absorb water, which subsequently could be released via application of mild pressure. Their antibacterial performance was evaluated based on the disinfection efficacies of E. coli and B. subtilis. The PSA/Ag cryogels had excellent disinfection efficacies showing close to a 3 log reduction of viable bacteria after a brief 15 s contact time. They were highly reusable as there was no significant difference in the disinfection efficacies over five cycles of operation. The biocidal action of the PSA/Ag cryogels is believed to be dominated by surface-controlled mechanisms that are dependent on direct contact of the interface of PSA/Ag cryogels with the bacterial cells. The PSA/Ag cryogels are thought to offer a simpler approach for drinking water disinfection in disaster relief applications.},

The water flux performance of existing FO membranes is largely limited by the internal concentration polarization (ICP) of solutes in their porous substrates. The current study investigated the use of nanocomposite substrates for controlling ICP and thus improving FO water flux. Polysulfone-nanocomposite (PSfN) substrates were prepared via phase inversion by incorporating porous zeolite nanoparticles in polysulfone. The PSfN0.5 (with 0.5 wt\% zeolite loading) substrate showed improved surface porosity and hydrophilicity. A thin film composite (TFC) polyamide active layer was prepared by interfacial polymerization on the PSfN0.5 substrate, and the resulting TFC-PFSN0.5 membrane showed significantly enhanced water permeability compared to the TFC membrane prepared on a conventional polysulfone substrate. Under identical testing conditions, the FO water flux of the TFC-PFSN0.5 membrane was more than doubled of that of the conventional TFC membrane. Using 2 M NaCl as draw solution (DS) and 0–0.01 M NaCl as feed solution (FS), PSfN0.5-TFC had an FO water flux as high as ∼80 LMH in the active layer facing DS (AL–DS) orientation and ∼40 LMH in the AL–FS orientation. Further analysis revealed that the incorporation of zeolite nanoparticles significantly reduced the substrate structural parameter (S=0.34 mm for PSfN0.5-TFC compared to 0.96 mm for TFC). The current study demonstrates for the first time the use of porous particles and nanocomposite substrates for controlling ICP in FO operation.},

The results showed improved fouling control with fine, rather than coarse, PAC provided the flux did not exceed the deposition flux for the fine PAC.

The layer-by-layer (LbL) method exhibits great flexibility for fabricating the active layer of FO membrane with controllable separation properties. The current work focused on investigating the effect of LbL active layer properties on the FO performance. A series of FO membranes were prepared with varied number of polyelectrolyte bilayers which were composed of positively charged poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) and negatively charged poly(sodium 4-styrene-sulfonate) (PSS), with either PAH or PSS as the terminating layer. The active layers were characterized in terms of contact angle, surface roughness, and zeta potential, which were exploited to explain the variations of the intrinsic transport properties (the hydraulic permeability and the solute permeability) of the polyelectrolyte multilayer films. FO filtration experiments were carried out to assess the performance of the same series of FO membranes. Both the filtration flux and the FO efficiency were demonstrated as a strong function of the LbL active layers. This dependency was rationalized by analyzing the relative importance of the different transport mechanisms during the FO processes, which were inherently correlated to the intrinsic transport properties of the multilayer films. The current investigation not only justifies the feasibility of improving the FO performance by properly controlling the number of the polyelectrolyte bilayers and the surface charge, but also makes the underlying mechanisms comprehensible.},

	abstract = {Novel crosslinked layer-by-layer (xLbL) forward osmosis (FO) membranes with a double-skinned design have been synthesized and characterized in the present work. Cross flow reverse osmosis test results showed that the membrane top skin generally had higher hydraulic resistance and better solute rejection compared to the bottom skin even when the same number of polyelectrolyte layers were deposited. The overall water permeability of the double-skinned FO membrane can be estimated from the respective values of the top and bottom skins using a resistance-in-series model. For FO tests performed at high feed solution (FS) concentration (0.5 M MgCl2), the water flux was not affected by the membrane separation properties nor its orientation. However, much higher FO water flux was obtained in the top-skin-facing-the-draw-solution (Top-DS) orientation compared to the alternative Top-FS orientation when the FS concentration was low. Using DI water as FS and 0.5 M MgCl2 as DS, FO water fluxes ranged from 40 to 80 L/m2 h in Top-DS and ∼30 L/m2 h in Top-FS. Higher DS concentrations resulted in greater FO water fluxes (e.g., 50–110 L/m2 h at 2 M MgCl2 DS). Fouling tests demonstrated that the double-skinned membrane had much better resistance against FO fouling in the Top-DS orientation. To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first systematic study on the synthesis and characterization of double-skinned xLbL membranes. In addition, their superior anti-fouling ability was experimentally demonstrated for the first time.},

In addition, chemical crosslinking of LbL polyelectrolyte layers was performed with glutaraldehyde (GA). The resultant crosslinked (the xLbL series) and non-crosslinked (the LbL series) membranes were characterized in terms of the substrate morphology and structure, the separation layer water permeability and salt rejection, and the FO water flux and solute flux performance. Both LbL and xLbL membranes had relatively high water permeability (∼ or \&gt;7.0 L/m2 h bar). On the other hand, the crosslinked xLbL membranes showed better and more stable MgCl2 rejection, leading to a relatively low FO solute reverse transport (the solute flux over water flux ratio \&lt; 6 mM regardless of draw solution (DS) concentration and membrane orientation). High FO water fluxes were achieved for both crosslinked and non-crosslinked membranes, where a thin substrate with finger-like pores were adopted to minimize internal concentration polarization in the porous support layer. The crosslinked membrane xLbL3 (with 3 PAH/PSS deposition layers) had an FO water flux of ∼100 L/m2 h in the active-layer-facing-DS orientation using a 2 or 3 M MgCl2 draw solution and distilled water as the feed water, which clearly demonstrates the potential of LbL membranes for high flux FO applications.},

Because standard biological parts are utilized to build the synthetic systems, it is important that each of these standard parts is well characterized and has a corresponding mathematical model that could simulate the characteristics of the part. These models could be used in computer aided design (CAD) tools during the design stage to facilitate the building of the model of biological systems. This paper describes the development of a mathematical model that is able to simulate both the dynamic and static performance of a biological device created using standard parts. We modeled an example quorum sensing device that produces green fluorescent protein (GFP) as reporter in the presence of Acyl Homoserine Lactone (AHL). The parameters of the model were estimated using experimental results. The simulation results show that the model was able to simulate behavior similar to experimental results. Since it is important that these models and the content in the models can be searchable and readable by machines, standard SBML (system biology markup language) format was used to store the models. All parts and reactions are fully annotated to enable easy searching, and the models follow the Minimum Information Requested In the Annotation of Models (MIRIAM) compliance as well as the Minimum Information About a Simulation Experiment (MIASE).},

	abstract = {This study investigated the fouling of pressure-driven ultrafiltration (UF) membrane and osmotically-driven forward osmosis (FO) membrane by organic macromolecules. Protein and humic acid, two types of ubiquitous identified membrane organic foulants, were chosen as the model foulants. It was found that the hydrodynamic conditions (initial flux and cross-flow velocity) and feedwater composition (foulant concentration, pH, ionic strength, and divalent ions concentration) played a significant role on the organic fouling of these two types of membranes. During the bovine serum albumin (BSA) ultrafiltration, drastic flux reduction was observed at high initial flux and/or low cross-flow velocity. A limiting flux existed during BSA filtration, beyond which membrane flux can not be sustained. Further increase in pressure over the limiting value did not enhance the stable flux. Foulant concentration had no effect on the stable flux, although the rate approaching to the stable flux increased proportionally with increasing foulant concentration. Fouling was most severe at the isoelectric point (IEP) of BSA (pH 4.7), where the electrostatic repulsion between foulant molecules is negligible. Membrane fouling became less severe at pHs away from the IEP. Increasing the ionic strength at pH 3.0 promoted severe fouling likely due to electric double layer (EDL) compression.},

	title = {Pressure retarded osmosis for osmotic power production: influence of internal concentration polarization and membrane fouling},
	abstract = {Pressure retarded osmosis (PRO) has attracted increasing interest in recent years due to its potential for harvesting the renewable and sustainable osmotic energy from the mixing of two water streams with different salinities. However, the performance of PRO process is strongly affected by the internal concentration polarization (ICP) and membrane fouling. This study characterized ICP and fouling in PRO processes by varying the operating conditions (such as draw and feed solution concentration and composition, membrane types, membrane orientation, temperature, and feed spacer geometry). The phenomenon of reverse solute diffusion from draw solution to feed solution and its adverse effect on ICP, fouling, and PRO performance were also investigated. The commercial cellulose triacetate (CTA) forward osmosis (FO) membranes were used in all the PRO experiments and the alginate was selected as a model foulant to study membrane fouling.

It was found that the PRO performance was improved by decreasing the feed solution concentration, increasing the draw solution concentration, orientating the membrane with its active layer towards the draw solution (AL-DS), and increasing temperature. The membrane with higher water permeability, lower solute permeability and lower structure parameter performed better in PRO process. It was also observed that membrane under PRO operation underwent severe deformation. Theoretically, the extent of membrane deformation is proportional to the applied pressure and the square of the feed spacer opening size and inversely proportional to the membrane mechanical strength. The severe membrane deformation led to the deterioration of the membrane separation properties and the drastic increase of the reverse solute diffusion, which results in enhanced ICP and thus the substantially reduced PRO performance.

Although the AL-DS membrane orientation exhibited greater PRO performance compared to the alternative orientation, it was found that this orientation was more prone to fouling. It was also found that reverse solute diffusion can enhance the membrane fouling. When the draw solution (DS) contained large quantities of fouling promoters (i.e., Ca2+ and Mg2+), severe organic fouling was observed. The effect of reverse solute diffusion enhanced fouling is related to (1) the type of draw solute and the rate of its diffusion into the feed solution (FS), and (2) the ability of the diffused draw solute to interact with foulant in the feed solution.

It was also found that the increase of DS concentration exacerbated the PRO fouling due to the synergistic effects of increased reverse solute diffusion and increased initial water flux level. However, the increase of applied hydraulic pressure mitigated the alginate fouling for NaCl draw solution but exacerbated the alginate fouling for CaCl2 draw solution due to the competing effects between the increased reverse solute diffusion and the reduced initial water flux. It was further found that the alginate fouling was more severe under PRO operation than that under forward osmosis (FO) operation at an identical initial water flux level using seawater-based DSs due to the faster reverse solute diffusion under PRO operation. Severe membrane fouling can also lead to the enhanced ICP, which causes additional water flux decline.},

The H2O2 yield increased with temperature despite H2O2 selectivity declining simultaneously due to faster H2O2 decomposition. Both H2O2 yield and selectivity improved with H2 feed pressure, however. Comparison of H2 consumption during H2O2 synthesis with the intrinsic membrane H2 permeability and the energetics of H2 oxidation on Pd surfaces revealed that the H2O2 productivity gain with temperature was primarily owed to the acceleration of reaction kinetics. The H2O2 selectivity enhancement with H2 feed pressure is attributed to the inhibition of direct H2O formation as a result of hindered O2 dissociation due to blocking of O atom adsorption sites on the membrane surface because of increasing occupation by H atoms. H2O2 decomposition and reduction on the Pd membrane surface accelerate much faster with temperature than H2O2 formation and need to be suppressed in order to maximize H2O2 yield and H2 utilization at higher temperatures.},

A typical RO crossflow cell was equipped with electrodes to allow in-situ EIS measurement of the fouling process during RO filtration. The EIS signals were converted to Nyquist plots of the negative imaginary impedance versus the real impedance, and used as a convenient means for characterization of fouling. Different forms of the Nyquist plot were obtained for different types of foulant. Also a significant shift in the Nyquist plots for silica, BSA and their mixtures occurred corresponding to the buildup of a foulant layer on the membrane surface. During the early stages of fouling, the Nyquist plots shifted noticeably while the transmembrane pressure (TMP) showed negligible increase. If EIS could perform on-line in plant operation, it could be a sensitive monitoring tool to detect early fouling in RO membrane filtration.},

The method involves a specially designed crossflow cell, the permeate of which flows to a dead-end MFI measuring device. This method has both the capability of capturing small foulant particles as well as simulating the crossflow hydrodynamic conditions of an reverse osmosis (RO) module. The traditional fouling indices, such as MFI, are measured using dead-end filtration and the crossflow hydrodynamic conditions in actual RO membrane filtration are not taken into account. In the current study, colloidal silica and humic acid were selected as representatives of a colloidal foulant and macromolecular foulant, respectively. When humic acid was added to the silica colloids, CFS-MFIUF was found to have a linear relationship with the humics concentration, suggesting that CFS-MFIUF is not only sensitive toward colloids, but also to organic matter. In all of the experiments, CFS-MFIUF was compared with the Modified Fouling Index Ultrafiltration constant flux (MFI-UFconst.flux). The results indicated that the conventional MFI-UFconst.flux tends to predict a higher fouling propensity by 10–40\% when compared to the CFS-MFIUF. CFS-MFIUF was also tested using seawater and pre-filtered seawater. The CFS-MFIUF shows significant improvement after pre-treatment, but this improvement cannot be detected by MFI-UFconst.flux. Preliminary RO experiments with silica and humic acid mixture solution indicated that CFS-MFIUF was more sensitive to fouling propensity. The CFS-MFIUF predicted transmembrane pressure (TMP) profile agreed well with the actual RO fouling behaviour with only 11\% deviation in the absence of salt. While with the salt in the solution, TMP profile predicted based on CFS-MFIUF plus osmosis pressure due to salt alone is unable to match the actual RO fouling behaviour. This indicates the potential contribution of cake enhanced osmosis pressure in RO fouling.},

The prediction based on resistivity, I′ from CFS-MFIUF measurement alone was found to underestimate the RO fouling for high salinity solutions. However, when incorporating the mass information from the CFS-MFIUF test to account for the CEOP effect, the prediction showed good agreement with the TMP profile of the RO system. The results indicated that the CFS-MFIUF test which includes the CEOP effect is a very promising technique to provide an estimation of the RO colloidal fouling profile. When the changes of cake thickness and porosity throughout the filtration were considered, the predicted TMP profile based on the model clearly indicated a two-stage of fouling profile which agreed well with the experimental data.

Factors affecting the performance on different fouling indices such as MFI-UF constant pressure, MFI-UF constant flux and newly proposed fouling index, CFS-MFIUF were investigated. Crossflow Sampler-Modified Fouling Index Ultrafiltration (CFS-MFIUF) utilises a typical crossflow unit to simulate the hydrodynamic conditions in the actual RO units followed by a dead-end unit to measure the fouling propensity of foulants. CFS-MFIUF was found sensitive to crossflow velocity. The crossflow velocity in the crossflow sampler unit influences the particle concentration and the particle size distribution in its permeate. CFS-MFIUF was also found sensitive to the permeate flux of both CFS and the dead-end cell. To closely simulate the hydrodynamic conditions of a crossflow RO unit, the flux used for CFS-MFIUF measurement was critical. The best option is to operate both the CFS and dead-end permeate flux at flux which is normally operated at industry RO units (∼20 L/m2 h), but this would prolong the test duration excessively. In this study, the dead-end flux was accelerated by reducing the dead-end membrane area while maintaining the CFS permeate flux at 20 L/m2 h. By doing so, a flux correction factor was investigated and applied to correlate the CFS-MFIUF measured at dead-end flux of 120 L/m2 h to CFS-MFIUF measured at dead-end flux of 20 L/m2 h for RO fouling rate prediction. Using this flux correction factor, the test duration of CFS-MFIUF can be shortened from 15 h to 2 h.},

	abstract = {Detecting biofouling noninvasively in real-time has been a long-standing challenge in membrane processes. Ultrasonic Time Domain Reflectometry (UTDR) offers the potential to address this challenge when used in a ‘canary cell’ that samples a slip stream from the feed to the membrane process. However, adapting UTDR to detect biofouling is problematic owing to the small difference in acoustic properties between a biofouling layer and water or a membrane. In this study UTDR has been adapted to detect biofouling by periodic dosing of colloidal silica as an ‘acoustic enhancer’. This novel UTDR technique was applied to detect biofouling on flat sheet polyethersulfone ultrafiltration (UF) and thin film composite polyamide reverse osmosis (RO) membranes in a canary cell flow configuration. The UTDR response correlates with the transmembrane pressure and off-line measurements of the biofilm thickness via confocal laser scanning microscopy, the bacterial count, and extra-polymeric cellular substances (EPS). The acoustic enhancer was shown to have no effect on the viability of the bacteria. Hence, UTDR can be used for the noninvasive real-time detection of biofouling in high pressure membrane processes such as RO by periodic dosing of an enhancer such as colloidal silica in a canary cell.},

	abstract = {The fouling propensity of an inorganic colloid (silica) and an organic (humic acid) and their mixture was studied in this paper. Fouling propensity was characterized as the modified fouling index (MFIUF) and specific cake resistance in dead-end UF at constant pressure. Experimental results for individual foulants demonstrated that MFIUF increased linearly with increasing particle concentration for both humic acid and colloidal silica over most of the concentration range, with deviations at the lowest concentrations. In terms of specific cake resistance, the individual foulants tended to have higher values at low concentrations that gradually declined to steady values at higher concentrations. These trends could be due to differences in cake formation and packing density with foulant flux. For the mixed foulants the presence of modest amounts of humic acid (\&lt;15 mg/L) tended to reduce both MFIUF and specific resistance below that of the colloidal silica alone (50–150 mg/L). This is attributed to the effect of the humic acid on silica packing density. At higher concentrations of humic acid (\&gt;20 mg/L) or lower concentrations of silica the mixture MFIUF started to exceed that of the colloid alone, possibly due to interstitial humic acid effects on cake resistance. Very low adsorption of humic acid on colloidal silica was also observed using Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) and zeta potential measurements. The results confirm that knowledge of the individual MFIUFs could not be used reliably to predict the fouling potential of the mixture.},

A UF membrane was used in the FFM, rather than a RO membrane, because it was more sensitive to fouling resistance and this decreased monitoring time and increased accuracy. The UTDR was coupled to a RO membrane cell to monitor the rate of cake thickness increase, which is the required information for the estimation of cake-enhanced osmotic pressure (CEOP). A model was developed to predict fouling in RO using data from the two monitors and combined both the cake resistance and the CEOP effect due to cake formation.},

A low-density humic layer (about 0.1 g of purified Aldrich humic acid (PAHA)/cm3) was formed at low initial flux (2 m/day or less) at pH 7 without calcium. It was several times denser at a higher initial flux, pH 4.5, or 1 mM Ca2+. Corresponding to the denser foulant layers under these conditions, PAHA accumulation was greatly increased. The denser foulant layers together with the greater PAHA accumulations were responsible for the severe flux reductions. Both virgin and fouled membranes were characterized by streaming potential measurements. While considerable differences existed for virgin membranes, humic acid fouled membranes exhibited identical surface charge properties.

	title = {Design and fabrication of nanofibrous thin film composite membranes by electrospinning for osmotically driven membrane processes},
	abstract = {Nowadays, high water demands due to fast global population growth and rapid economic development call for new technologies to provide clean water with less energy consumption. The serious environmental pollution caused by fossil fuel usage also require us to develop environmentally friendly technologies to harvest energy. As an emerging technology, osmotically driven membrane processes (ODMPs) including forward osmosis (FO) and pressure retarded osmosis (PRO) processes, are considered to be attractive technologies to treat waste water, recycle used water and harvest energy from salinity-gradients. However, FO and PRO technologies are still in the development stage. Developing osmotic membranes with both high water permeation and excellent ion rejection is a challenging task. The desired osmotic membrane may be a thin film composite (TFC) membrane consisting of an ultrathin polyamide layer with high water permeability and low solute permeability, and a highly porous support layer for low internal concentration polarization (ICP), which is one of the obstacles to improving FO/PRO membrane performance. In addition, high mechanical properties are essential for the membrane to withstand high hydraulic pressures in PRO processes. Fortunately, electrospun nanofibrous membranes have great potential to fulfil all the requirements of an ideal membrane support layer due to their open and porous structural features and ease with which nanomaterials can be incorporated to increase the mechanical properties of the nanofibers. Additionally, interfacial polymerization can be carried out on electrospun nanofibrous membrane surfaces to obtain an ultrathin polyamide selective layer. After incorporating nanomaterials in either the polyamide selective layer or the support layer, thin film nanocomposite (TFN) membranes may have great potential to exhibit excellent performance in ODMPs.

The objectives of this research are to design and develop novel nanofiber-based composite membranes for ODMPs. Specifically, this thesis presents the development of novel nanofiber-supported polyamide TFC and TFN membranes with high water permeation, good selectivity, and excellent mechanical properties for FO and PRO processes. Electrospinning was utilized to fabricate a variety of highly porous nanofibrous substrates while interfacial polymerization was exploited to form the thin polyamide rejection layer on the substrate.

In the beginning, we explored the feasibility of using electrospun polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanofibers as the substrate to make high-performance FO membranes. polyamide thin films were successfully formed via interfacial polymerization directly on two electrospun PVDF nanofiber substrates, S1 and S2, having different surface properties in terms of pore size and surface roughness. Experimental results revealed that a denser and less permeable polyamide layer was formed on the S1 substrate which possessed relatively smaller pore sizes (mean pore size: 0.32 ± 0.07 μm; maximum pore size: 0.50 ± 0.10 μm), while a looser polyamide layer with higher water permeability was attained on the S2 substrate with larger pore size (mean pore size: 0.40 ± 0.02 μm; maximum pore size: 0.59 ± 0.04 μm). The difference in polyamide layer structure was believed to be associated with the substrate structure, leading to different cross-linking degrees during the interfacial polymerization. The basic FO performance of resulting TFC membranes has been investigated. A water flux of 30.4 L/m2h was achieved when the active layer was oriented towards the 1.0 M NaCl draw solution while the ratio of reverse salt flux to water flux could be kept as low as 0.21 g/L.

Following the success of the PVDF nanofiber composite FO membrane, some nanomaterials were proposed for incorporation in the nanofibrous substrates to provide more water channels and improve the substrate's hydrophilicity. We fabricated a novel TFN membrane consisting of a polyetherimide (PEI) nanofibrous substrate incorporating silica nanoparticles and an ultrathin polyamide skin layer. PEI was also chosen in this research as it is a versatile polymer with a wide range of applications due to its excellent thermal, mechanical and solvent-resistance properties. It was verified that the incorporation of silica nanoparticles assisted in reducing the structure parameter of the substrate in terms of porosity, increasing additional water channels and hydrophilicity, and improving membrane performance significantly in the FO process.

To further enhance both the performance and mechanical properties of the composite membrane, we proposed and fabricated a novel TFN membrane consisting of a PEI nanofibrous support reinforced by functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (f-CNTs) and an ultrathin polyamide rejection layer. In addition to the superior inter-connected porous structure of the nanofibrous support, the well-distributed f-CNTs in the nanofibers increased the substrate porosity by 18\%, reduced the structure parameter by 30\%, and significantly improved the substrate tensile strength by 53\%. The high mechanical strength provided by the embedded f-CNTs enabled us to further increase the substrate porosity to reduce the ICP, which was demonstrated by the high performance of TFN-2 FO membrane with a structure parameter of 310 µm. Its water flux at 1.0 M NaCl draw solution was 61 and 33 L/m2h in the active layer-facing-DS (AL-DS) and active layer-facing-feed water (AL-FW) orientations, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that the CNTs incorporation increases both water flux and membrane mechanical strength. It is believed that this novel design strategy has great implications for PRO membrane fabrication.

In the last part of this study, we have successfully fabricated a novel TFN membrane consisting of a tiered structure of f-CNTs-reinforced PEI nanofibrous support and an ultrathin polyamide-based selective skin layer for PRO process. The tiered support was made by fine and coarse PEI nanofiber layers. The fine fiber reinforced with well dispersed f-CNTs has been found to increase mechanical stability of the polyamide selective layer, allowing the support to withstand high hydraulic pressure in the PRO system. The optimized membrane can endure a trans-membrane pressure up to 24 bar and generate a peak power density as high as 17.3 W/m2 at 16.9 bar using synthetic seawater brine (1.0 M NaCl) as the draw solution against de-ionized (DI) water. In addition, the long term PRO results show that this membrane can generate a stable power density of 15.0 ± 0.5 W/m2 for a test period of 10 hours. This demonstrates that the membrane holds great potential to be used in the PRO process.

In conclusion, this thesis presents the design and development of novel nanofibrous TFC and TFN membranes based on studies of the fundamental mechanisms of interfacial polymerization on a variety of nanofibrous substrates, fabrication of highly porous nanofibrous TFN FO membrane by incorporation of silica nanoparticles, development of robust and highly porous nanofibrous TFN FO membrane by incorporation of f-CNTs, and the design of a PRO membrane with a tiered structure. This work contributes to the development of membrane fabrication technology and facilitates practical applications of nanofibrous membranes in ODMPs.},

Improving the efficiency of oil-water separation via membranes entails novel techniques for studying the complex interactions between the oil droplets and membrane underlying fouling. This paper presents the first study that applies optical coherence tomography (OCT) to the characterization of membrane fouling by oil emulsions. A series of dead-end filtration experiments was performed to characterize the rejection of oil droplets ({\textasciitilde} 10 µm; hexadecane) by the membrane structure (0.45 µm PVDF) via three-dimensional (3D) OCT scanning in real time. The experimental results were compared with the control experiments with {\textasciitilde} 10 µm glass beads to identify the optical artifacts. Both the external and internal fouling by the oil droplets were successfully revealed by analyzing the variation in OCT intensity at various layers that were mathematically defined in terms of the coordinate surfaces parallel to, and above and below, the feed-membrane interface. The evolution of membrane fouling was quantified by evaluating the fraction of fouling voxels as a function of time at varied depths. This study demonstrates that the OCT-based characterization has the potential to shed light on the complex interactions occurring in oil-water separations via membrane filtration, particularly by providing real-time non-invasive monitoring of internal fouling, the understanding of which is valuable for both fundamental research and practical applications.},

A global carbamazepine (CBZ) photocatalytic degradation rate constant at steady state was achieved at (19.4 ± 2.35) × 10−3 min−1 with hydraulic residence times (HRTs) in the range of 30–300 min using a visible-light responsive C–N–S tridoped TiO2 (T0.05-450). An alkaline pH condition was favorable for the CBZ photocatalytic degradation. The inhibitory effects of inorganic anions on the CBZ photocatalytic degradation followed the order of silica \&gt; phosphate \&gt; nitrate \&gt; bicarbonate \&gt; sulfate \&gt; chloride. The net effect of humic acid (HA) on the CBZ degradation depended on the three competitive phenomena: (i) HA as an electron shuttle promoting the generation of O 2 - while reducing the electron–hole recombination, (ii) HA competing with CBZ for the active sites of the photocatalyst, and (iii) HA contributing to the light attenuation in the photoreactor. The MF membrane realized effective separation of T0.05-450 as the turbidity of permeate water was \&lt;0.1 NTU. A steady-state transmembrane pressure (TMP) was achieved after its increase in the first 2 h due to the deposition of TiO2 cake layer on the membrane surface. NaOH (pH = 11) and 0.5 mM EDTA (pH = 11) solutions were efficient for cleaning the membrane surface fouled by HA. For the long-term operation of the sMPR system, the reduction of CBZ photocatalytic degradation efficiency could be attributed to the decrease of the photocatalyst dosage in the suspension, and the aggregation and deactivation of TiO2 particles during the prolonged operation.},

The distinct operating conditions lead to unique technical challenges during the exploitation of FO technology. According to a comprehensive literature investigation, one of the stringent barriers is lacking of effective FO membranes. The objectives of this research were to develop high performance FO membranes, and furthermore, to systematically study the mass transport and the governing mechanisms in FO process.
Thin film composite (TFC) FO membranes with a tailored support structure were developed in this study. The membranes consisted of a highly porous substrate with finger-like pore structure, which was prepared via phase inversion, and a polyamide rejection layer synthesized by interfacial polymerization. The TFC FO membranes had small structural parameters due to the thin cross-section, low tortuosity, and high porosity of the substrates. The membrane rejection layers exhibited superior separation properties (higher water permeability and excellent selectivity) relative to commercial FO membranes. Under FO testing conditions, these membranes achieved high water flux while maintaining relatively low solute reverse diffusion. Comparison of the synthesized TFC FO membranes with commercial FO and reverse osmosis (RO) membranes revealed the critical importance of the substrate structure, with a straight finger-like pore structure preferred over a spongy pore structure to minimize internal concentration polarization (ICP), a unique and critical problem resulting in low water flux in the osmotically driven membrane processes. In addition, membranes with high water permeability and excellent selectivity are preferred to achieve both high FO water flux and low solute flux. The results proved that TFC membranes with a tailored porous substrate and rejection layer are promising for FO applications.
In the study of polyamide rejection layer synthesis, the influence of monomer concentrations (i.e., m-phenylenediamine (MPD) and trimesoyl chloride (TMC) concentrations) on the membrane separation properties as well as the FO performance was systematically investigated. A strong trade-off between the water permeability and salt rejection of the membranes was observed, where reducing the MPD concentration or increasing the TMC concentration may result in a higher membrane permeability but a lower salt rejection. In FO tests, membranes with poor salt rejection had severe solute reverse diffusion, which enhanced the severity of ICP. It was found that the FO water flux was governed by both the membrane water permeability and solute rejection. For a membrane with higher water permeability but lower solute rejection, the reduced membrane frictional resistance was compensated simultaneously by the more severe solute-reverse-diffusion-induced ICP. The net effect on the FO water flux depends on the competition of these two opposing mechanisms. Under conditions where solute reverse diffusion may cause severe ICP (e.g., high draw solution concentration and high water flux level), membranes need to be optimized to achieve a high salt rejection even if this is at the expense of lower water permeability.
In view of the importance of the water permeability and salt permeability on FO performance, a systematic comparison study of prevailing semi-permeable FO membranes with nanofiltration (NF)-like and RO-like separation properties in terms of flux performance and fouling behavior was conducted. Due to the crucial influence of solute reverse diffusion on FO water flux, the high-rejection RO-like FO membranes generally performed better than the NF-like counterparts in sodium chloride based FO tests. On the other hand, the high permeability of NF-like FO membranes could achieve higher water flux, when proper draw solutes were used to minimize draw solute leakage. Fouling tests suggested that the NF-like TFC FO membranes tended to be more fouling resistant due to their relatively smooth membrane surface. This work further elucidated the major mechanisms that govern the FO performance. These mechanisms were summarized as a frictional resistance loss mechanism (MR), solute-reverse-diffusion-induced ICP (MICP-Js), concentration of feed solutes (concentrative ICP or MICP-feed in the active-layer-facing-draw-solution orientation) and dilution of draw solutes (dilutive ICP or MICP-draw in the active-layer-facing-feed-solution orientation). These mechanisms are related to the properties of membrane, draw and feed solutions. This work led to a set of systematic criteria for the selection of FO membranes, draw solution and optimization of other operating conditions, of which the practicability was demonstrated in potential FO applications.},

	abstract = {Polyethylene (PE) is one of the most produced synthetic resins in the world. Functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) is a potential nanoscale filler to realize the next generation strong and multifunctional PE composites. We demonstrate that MWCNTs grafted with short n-alkyl groups are effective nanofillers for mechanical reinforcement of PE composites. At 1 wt\% filler loading, the yield stress and Young's modulus improve significantly up to 54 and 63\% compared with neat PE, respectively. Among ductile properties, tensile strength increases up to 30\%; ultimate strain is preserved; and toughness increases up to 33\%. More important, we show that short n-alkyl groups can be grafted on MWCNTs much easier than long chain polymers. Further, we find that alkyl groups of C14–C18 chains have the optimum length for reinforcement. The optimum density of grafted alkyl groups is around 0.390–0.423 μmol/mg when the C14 alkyl groups are used. Overall, the results manifest that MWCNTs grafted with n-alkyl groups with suitable length and density are efficient nanoscale fillers for high-performance PE composites. POLYM. ENG.

Foulant analysis indicated great accumulation amounts of SP and sTEP on the cleaned membrane. FT-IR spectra further confirmed that hydroxyl and amide groups in the soluble substances preferred to attach on the cleaned membranes. While, the initially formed cake layers on the membranes played a role to decrease zeta potential of cleaned membranes, which created less interaction with the soluble substances.

Two MBRs were operated at different food to microorganism (F/M) ratios and the permeate was fed to the respective RO membrane.

The presence of filters ({\textasciitilde} 5 μm) in the RO feed line and recycled RO concentrate line significantly alleviated RO fouling. Chemical analysis of RO foulants indicated that the soluble polysaccharides and transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) accumulated on the RO membranes were strongly associated with RO fouling.

	abstract = {Air sparging is now a standard approach to reduce concentration polarization and fouling of membrane modules in membrane bioreactors (MBRs). The hydrodynamic shear stresses, bubble-induced turbulence and cross flows scour the membrane surfaces and help reduce the deposit of foulants onto the membrane surface. However, the detailed quantitative knowledge on the effect of air sparging remains lacking in the literature due to the complex hydrodynamics generated by the gas–liquid flows. To date, there is no valid model that describes the relationship between the membrane fouling performance and the flow hydrodynamics. The present study aims to examine the impact of hydrodynamics induced by air sparging on the membrane fouling mitigation in a quantitative manner. A modelled hollow fiber module was placed in a cylindrical bubble column reactor at different axial heights with the trans-membrane pressure (TMP) monitored under constant flux conditions. The configuration of bubble column without the membrane module immersed was identical to that studied by Gan et al. (2011) using Phase Doppler Anemometry (PDA), to ensure a good quantitative understanding of turbulent flow conditions along the column height. The experimental results showed that the meandering flow regime which exhibits high flow instability at the 0.3 m is more beneficial to fouling alleviation compared with the steady flow circulation regime at the 0.6 m. The filtration tests also confirmed the existence of an optimal superficial air velocity beyond which a further increase is of no significant benefit on the membrane fouling reduction. In addition, the alternate aeration provided by two air stones mounted at the opposite end of the diameter of the bubble column was also studied to investigate the associated flow dynamics and its influence on the membrane filtration performance. It was found that with a proper switching interval and membrane module orientation, the membrane fouling can be effectively controlled with even smaller superficial air velocity than the optimal value provided by a single air stone. Finally, the testing results with both inorganic and organic feeds showed that the solid particle composition and particle size distribution all contribute to the cake formation in a membrane filtration system.},

	abstract = {Membrane distillation (MD) is an emerging technology for seawater desalination that is traditionally accomplished by conventional separation processes such as thermal distillation or reverse osmosis. It is potentially cost effective as it is feasible to utilize low-grade waste heat and/or alternative renewable energy sources. However, the industrialization of MD is impeded by several technical challenges which include the membrane pore-wetting problem, low permeability, and concentration/temperature polarization effect, etc. This thesis provides a comprehensive review on the state-of-the-art of MD technology with focuses on some areas that need to be further investigated or strengthened, such as novel membranes and improved membrane module design with the aid of mathematical modeling, which may offer strategies to address the challenges.A preliminary study of the performance improvement of the hollow fiber-based direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) system has been conducted. The original hydrophobic polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) hollow fiber and two modified membranes (unmodified, plasma modified and chemically modified) were used and compared. It was found that modified membranes presented better hydrophobicity while maintaining similar structural properties and less vulnerability to pore wetting, thus resulting in more sustainable long-term performance. Single fiber tests in combination with heat transfer analysis showed that a critical length Lc existed to assure sufficient driving force along the fiber to maintain a high MD efficiency. In addition, the over MD coefficient decreased with increasing packing density.},

	abstract = {Low-field bench-top nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been applied to investigate the hydrodynamics in novel hollow fiber modules with four different configurations of randomly-packed, spacer-knitted, curly and semi-curly fibers, specifically designed for the membrane distillation (MD) process. Imaging, spatially resolved velocity maps and propagators (probability distributions of displacement/velocity) were all acquired in the modules with flow in the shell side. The MRI data were correlated with overall module performance. The results have revealed that the curly configuration exhibited more significant transverse flow and hence enhanced mixing, compared to the randomly packed configuration; this was consistent with an enhanced MD performance in terms of permeation flux. Interestingly, the velocity maps of the spacer-knitted fiber design indicated a significant flow channeling in the center of the module, despite its enhanced MD performance. Fortunately, combined with further investigations on the localized velocity images of this configuration, the acquisition of propagators provided valuable information in revealing the existence of reduced stagnant regions and significant transverse flow at varied operating conditions, which indicated a better overall mixing and hence confirmed its module performance.},

	abstract = {Abstract Membrane-based separation processes have found numerous applications in various industries over the past decades. However, higher energy consumption, lower productivity, and shorter membrane lifespan due to polarization and membrane fouling continue to present severe technical challenges to membrane-based separation. Improved membrane module design and novel hydrodynamics offer strategies to address these challenges. This review focuses on hollow fiber membrane modules which are well suited to membrane contactor separation processes. Attempts to improve membrane module design should begin with a better understanding of the mass transfer in the hollow fiber module; therefore, this review provides a summary of prior studies on the mass transfer models related to both the shell-side and tube-side fluid dynamics. Based on the mass transfer analysis, two types of technique to enhance hollow fiber membrane module performance are discussed: (1) passive enhancement techniques that involve the design and fabrication of effective modules with optimized flow geometry or (2) active enhancement techniques that uses external energy to induce a high shear regime to suppress the undesirable fouling and concentration polarization phenomena. This review covers the progress over the past five years on the most commonly proposed techniques such as bubbling, vibrations, and ultrasound. Both enhancement modes have their advantages and drawbacks. Generally, the passive enhancement techniques offer modest improvement of the system performance, while the active techniques, including bubbling, vibrating, and ultrasound, are capable of providing as high as 3?15 times enhancement of the permeation flux. Fundamentally, the objectives of module design should include the minimization of the cost per amount of mass transferred (energy consumption and module production cost) and the maximization of the system performance through optimizing the flow geometry and operating conditions of the module, scale-up potential, and expansion of niche applications. It is expected that this review can provide inspiration for novel module development.

The operation parameters such as filtration duration, backwash duration, backwash strength and the aid of air scouring during backwash were investigated in order to optimize the filtration performance and fouling control. The underlying fouling limitation mechanisms which result in those optimized operation parameters were also explored. It was found that periodical backwash with the permeate can provide effective removal of fouling layer and reduce the fouling rate during the filtration cycle. Results also indicated the strong inter-correlation among backwash strength and filtration duration and their effect on fouling rate. Excessive backwash strength was found unable to minimize fouling, and in fact, resulted in higher fouling rate during filtration. The percentage of removable fouling by backwash was also significantly affected by the inter-correlation between the backwash strength and backwash duration. By analyzing the composition of the feed, permeate and the solution after backwash, it was found that UF membrane (pore size 0.04 μm) can remove more than 60\% of biopolymers. The biopolymers rejected by the UF membrane formed the cake on the membrane surface, and this fouling cake can be easily removed by periodical backwash.},

The resultant disinfection layer consists of porous and entangled network of Ag/MWNTs which is sufficiently stable for normal filtration operation. This physical attachment method resulted in insignificant water flux drop since chemical treatment or photon/plasma-assisted sputtering of the membrane was not involved. The composite membrane significantly reduces the formation of biofilm due to the presence of silver nanoparticles on the membrane surface and the leached silver ions. Upon depletion of the silver content due to silver leaching, the coating can be easily detached from the membrane surface and replenished with silver nanoparticles for recycle, while retaining good antimicrobial performances for prolonged use. The technique used in this study can be extended to other types of antimicrobial agents, the support materials and membranes.},

Reduced graphene oxide layers work as "bricks" with an aim to provide an open nanoscale scaffold and connect porous carbon, as well as modulate the ratio between mesopores and micropores. This new material has a large surface area (957 m2 g-1), high nitrogen content (6.6 at\%), excellent conductivity (up to 5.1 S cm-1), and favorable hierarchical meso- and microporosity. Benefiting from these intriguing features, this material shows an ultrahigh specific capacitance of 361 F g-1 in an aqueous electrolyte. The as-assembled asymmetric supercapacitors with the designed carbon materials as negative electrodes and porous cobalt oxide nanorods as positive electrodes deliver a high-energy of 50.1 W h kg-1 with a cell voltage of up to 1.6 V. Further, this material shows high electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline medium comparable with that of 20 wt\% platinum-carbon electrodes, with better methanol tolerance and long-term durability.

	abstract = {Dynamic shear-enhanced filtration through vibration can be an effective method to reduce concentration polarization and membrane fouling in high solids suspension loaded membrane applications such as membrane bioreactors (MBRs). In this approach, the wall shear rate on the membrane surface is one of the most important parameters which can control the fouling in vibrating membrane systems. In the present study, the effects of vibration parameters (i.e., frequency and amplitude) and geometrical parameters (i.e., fibre radius and distance between the fibres in a bundle of fibres) on the wall shear rate at the membrane surface have been studied both analytically and numerically. The analytical solution uses the cylindrical coordinate for the analysis of a vibrating single fibre. The former Cartesian solution for a flat sheet membrane used also for fibres by others, was compared to the new solution. It was found that a relative error of up to 75\% can arise comparing the two solutions within a realistic range of hollow fibre diameters. The results also showed that fibres with smaller radii are more effective for the vibrating system. Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations were also performed to examine the optimal configuration and distance between fibres for different configurations. The computational results with two remote fibres were first obtained and compared with the analytical results of a single vibrating fibre. The comparison was satisfactory and shows the compatibility of the modeling and analytical results. Subsequently, the CFD analysis was conducted for a fibre bundle with both staggered and in-line arrangements, and the former was found to be marginally more responsive to vibrations.},

GLMC process has been gaining popularity in recent years as a potential alternative for CO2 separation from various gas streams, such as biogas, natural gas, and flue gas. However, no commercial CO2 removal process using GLMC technology is presently in operation. The main technical barrier is membrane wetting. Hence, this study aims at developing highly hydrophobic and efficient porous hollow fiber membranes with strong chemical resistance for GLMC application. Overall, the hydrophobic hollow fiber membranes with controlled pore structures were prepared by the novel surface modification approaches and through the formation of highly hydrophobic inorganic-organic composite membranes. This study proves the important role of membrane engineering in terms of fabrication and modification techniques in facilitating commercialization of GLMC application.},

The SEM result reveals that the penetrated finger-like structure in sublayer is suppressed, and sponge-like structure begins to be developed. The mechanical strength and thermal stability of composite membrane are improved due to the existence of hydrogen bond between TiO2 and polymer. The permeate flux is also enlarged due to the improved hydrophilicity and porosity. Compared with neat PPESK membrane, the composite membranes present improved antifouling properties, showing lower filtration resistances, MFI values and better flux recover property during high temperature condensed water treatment. The optimal addition amount of TiO2 is 2 wt.\%. The high temperature condensed water with excess oil and iron can be treated efficiently using PPESK/TiO2 composite membrane.

	title = {Aquaporin based biomimetic membrane for water reuse and desalination},
	abstract = {Water resources have become a scarcity in the world. As a result of that, reverse osmosis (RO) membrane based desalination has experienced a remarkable growth. However, current existing RO membranes are still less permeable.

After millions of years of evolution, aquaporins, the large family of water transport proteins in cell membranes, are nature’s own water channels with high water permeability and excellent salt rejection combined together. It is estimated that an aquaporin-based biomimetic membrane (ABM) can potentially achieve a water permeability two orders of magnitude higher compared to existing commercial RO membranes. So far, several conceptual designs for producing the AqpZ based biomimetic membrane have been proposed. Nevertheless, in terms of producing the large area defects-free biomimetic membrane, the successes of those concepts have not been reported yet.

The target of this study is, mainly, the synthesizing of the first generation ABM. Three parts of work are presented in three chapters. First of all, the effects of proteoliposomes compositions on separation properties of proteoliposomes are systematically studied. Secondly, the first generation ABM, with a defect-free and large membrane area, is successfully prepared by a combined proteoliposome and interfacial polymerization method. Last, and not least, a further systematic study of these ABM was carried out, with ABM performance suitable for both forward osmosis (FO) and High-pressure RO.},

Despite the growing interest in aquaporin-based biomimetic membranes (ABMs), it is challenging to produce robust and defect-free ABMs that can be easily scaled up. In the current study, a thin film composite (TFC) ABM was prepared by the interfacial polymerization method, where AquaporinZ-containing proteoliposomes were added to the m-phenylene-diamine aqueous solution. Control membranes, either without aquaporins or with inactive (mutant) aquaporins, were also similarly prepared. The separation performance of these membranes was evaluated by cross-flow reverse osmosis (RO) tests. Compared to the controls, the active ABM achieved significantly higher water permeability (∼4 L/m2 h bar) with comparable NaCl rejection (∼97\%) at an applied pressure of 5 bar. Its permeability was ∼40\% higher compared to a commercial brackish water RO membrane (BW30) and an order of magnitude higher compared to a seawater RO membrane (SW30HR), which clearly demonstrates the great potential of the TFC ABM for desalination applications.},

The proposed approach, named group-by-group approach, calculates the average aquatic ETP as the sum of the impacts generated by acknowledged groups of influential chemicals. This approach firstly identifies the influential chemicals. According to the chemical property and the impact pathway to the aquatic ecosystem, the important chemicals are then categorized into groups under three categories. Depending on the characteristics of the defined groups, different strategies are applied to determine the impact of each group. The group-by-group approach takes the merits of two most commonly-used approaches, chemical specific approach and whole effluent approach. The results from the case study indicated that this approach reduces the reliance on the comprehensive chemical composition analysis and temporal ecotoxicology test of the complex desalination brine.

When surface water is used as feed solution (FS) for FO and PRO, these membranes can be fouled by microalgae that are ubiquitous in rivers, lakes, and seawater. This study systematically investigates FO/PRO fouling by a model microalgae Chlorella sorokiniana. Direct microscopic observation was used to characterize FO/PRO fouling in conjunction with water flux measurements. The study demonstrated that direct microscopic observation can be highly valuable in characterizing the deposition of microalgae on FO/PRO membrane. Using a concentration stepping method, a critical flux (critical concentration) behavior was revealed. Stable flux can be achieved by operating below the critical flux (critical concentration) level. Microalgal FO/PRO fouling was more severe and less reversible when divalent Mg2+ ions were present in the FS and the draw solution (DS). The use of Mg2+-based DS can promote severe fouling due to the reverse diffusion of Mg2+ into the FS, even if Mg2+ is not present in the original FS. The use of FS spacer was beneficial in enhancing the initial flux as well as reducing the tendency of membrane fouling.},

Though boasting a promising future for industrial application, several technical challenges still need to be tackled, including membrane wetting and fouling, relatively low membrane permeability (flux), concentration/temperature polarization effect, uncertainty of economic benefit, etc. Therefore, novel membrane development and improved module design will offer effective strategic solutions to these challenges. This thesis provides a comprehensive review of previous studies on MD with a focus on the areas of membrane wetting and fouling, especially when seawater is contaminated by spilled or discharged oil. Moreover, membrane module modeling based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and system optimization in terms of energy and economic analysis were also investigated. Overall, it is expected that the PhD study can help sought potential strategies to address the challenges for the practical application of MD process, such as the prevention of membrane wetting, reduction of membrane fouling by oil contamination, MD module modeling and system optimization, through better design and operation conditions.},

	abstract = {Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)/polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) hollow fiber membranes were developed via thermally induced phase separation (TIPS) method for direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD). The effects of PTFE addition on the thermal behavior of the dope mixtures and membrane formation were investigated. It was found that the crystallization of PVDF was significantly enhanced with increased nucleation sites provided by PTFE particles, leading to promoted formation of smaller spherulites in a greater density. Furthermore, the improved uniformity and increased amount of cavity between the spherical crystallites coherently facilitated the formation of smaller pores ranging from 0.08 to 0.12μm. With certain PTFE loading, the membranes exhibited improved porosity, water permeability and hydrophobicity as well as enhanced tensile strength of 9.4±0.3MPa. To examine the DCMD performance, the membranes were tested under various conditions using 3.5wt\% NaCl solution. A stable permeation flux of 28.3kgm−2h−1 at the feed temperature of 60°C with 99.99\% NaCl rejection for over 50h of operation was achieved, which is comparable with similar type of PVDF membranes while the newly developed membrane exhibited better mechanical strength. This study suggests that the as-spun PVDF/PTFE hollow fiber membranes have potential for DCMD applications.},

	abstract = {The combination of nonsolvent and thermally induced phase separation (N-TIPS) method has shown promising ability in harvesting the features from the nonsolvent induced phase separation (NIPS) and thermally induced phase separation (TIPS) processes for developing membranes with a tailorable surface pore structure. However, previous approaches have been subjected to either the formation of macrovoids or dense layer due to the dominant NIPS effect, or required sophisticated instruments and operation skills. In this work, a facile attempt was carried out to fabricate novel polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) hollow fiber membranes with tunable surface pore structure while maintaining the narrow pore size distribution and mechanical strength. A modified N-TIPS method was developed by using mixed diluents: dimethyl phthalate (DMP) as a water-immiscible poor solvent for TIPS process, and triethyl phosphate (TEP) as a water-miscible neutral solvent to bridge the TIPS and NIPS processes. To further control the membrane formation especially near the membrane surface, an amphiphilic additive Pluronic F127 was also added as a potential pore-former and surface hydrophilicity modifier. PVDF hollow fiber membranes with a highly porous structure and a narrow pore size distribution were successfully synthesized by using TEP and Pluronic F127 in the N-TIPS process. The mechanism of N-TIPS process was thoroughly discussed. The water permeability of the membrane increased significantly from 389 ± 30–922 ± 36 L m–2 h–1 bar–1, with overall porosity improved from 50 ± 2.2–69 ± 2.9\%, and a mean pore size of {\textasciitilde} 0.18 µm. The membranes produced by N-TIPS method also exhibited a good tensile strength ranging from 5.6 ± 0.1–6.5 ± 0.2 MPa, showing a great potential for a broad range of water applications after further modifications. Besides, the formation of piezoelectric β-phase crystals of the PVDF membrane was observed when the mixed diluent was used, which sheds light on the possible applications of resultant membranes in electrochemical separation process.},

	abstract = {In the present work, poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) asymmetric microporous hollow fiber membranes were successfully fabricated using nonsolvent-induced phase inversion method which has not been reported previously. Analyses of thermodynamic characteristics of the PVDF-HFP/NMP/water system without/with PVP as an additive and the rheological property of the spinning dopes were carried out as a first step. Subsequently, the effects of spinning conditions (wet spinning, air gap, bore fluid composition), dope concentration and PVP addition on the resultant hollow fiber membranes were studied in terms of membrane morphology, structure, pure water flux and molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) as well as their hydrophobicity and mechanical properties. It was found that the wet spinning process produced hollow fibers with irregular inner contour under present experimental conditions. The strong viscoelastic property of PVDF-HFP material was thought to be associated with this phenomenon. A partial release of accumulated back stress in the nascent fibers might have caused the macromolecules to move inward in the transverse direction. Increasing the air gap could eliminate this inner contour deformation, as the outer surface of the nascent fiber was not vitrified prior to entering the water bath, thus allowing the orientated macromolecules to be relaxed. In addition, the nascent fiber is generally expected to experience an elongational stretch over the distance of the air gap, which might help to smooth the inner surface. Membranes made from the PVDF-HFP/NMP dopes were found to have small pure water fluxes no matter what the polymer concentration, the bore fluid composition and the air gap were used in the spinning processes. The pure water flux can be increased by adding PVP into the dope solution, up to 5 wt.\% PVP in the dope can promote the formation of macrovoids in the membrane. When the PVP content was increased to 10 wt.\%, the macrovoids were suppressed, but the membrane still presented a higher porosity, which was reflected from the significant increase in the pure water flux from 60 to 107 L/(h m2 atm). In addition, PDVF-HFP hollow fiber membranes were more hydrophobic than those membranes made from pure PVDF, the former also exhibited pronounced ductile behavior when compared with the latter.},

In the present work, the effect of shear rate on the fabrication of poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) asymmetric microporous hollow fiber membranes has been studied in terms of membrane morphology, pure water flux, filtration rejection, mechanic strength and the performance of the membrane contactors made by as-spun hollow fibers for CO(2) Capture.
The PVDF-HFP copolymer possesses strong viscoelasticity, which is believed to be associated with the occurrence of an irregular morphology in the PVDF-HFP hollow fibers made at a high dope extrusion rate. For the first time, the viscoelastic Mach number was applied to elaborate the deformation of the inner contour of the membranes by means of characterizing the delayed die swell in the process of hollow fiber fabrication. Based on the Mach number, several batches of PVDF-HFP dope solutions with an appropriate viscosity were adopted for hollow fiber fabrication at given dope extrusion rates.
The effects of the shear rate on the permeation flux and molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) of the membranes made by Batch III-2L5T dope solution (2 wt.\% LiCl and 0.5\% Tween 80 as the additive) presented a V shape curve; while for the polymer dope of Batch V-2P9G (2 wt.\% PVP and 9 wt.\% glycerol as the additive), the effect of the shear rate on the resultant membranes showed a different pattern: increasing the shear rate resulted in smaller MWCOs, enhanced water permeation flux and higher elongation strength. These behaviors have been discussed thoroughly based on the shear-induced macromolecular chain orientation and close packing, variation of the porosity with the shear rate and shear-thinning theological property of the dope solution under a high shear stress.

	abstract = {Polyvinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluropropylene (PVDF-HFP) has received much attention recently as a promising membrane material for membrane contactor application. A systematic study has been carried out to investigate the effects of polyethylene glycol (PEG) with different molecular weights and different loadings as an additive on the fabrication of PVDF-HFP asymmetric microporous hollow fiber membranes. Moreover, the synergetic effects of coagulation temperature and the second additive (lithium chloride: Lid) with PEG are also evaluated.
Experiments revealed that the addition of PEG into the PVDF-HFP/NMP solution resulted in the system thermodynamically less stable in reaction with water, promoting rapid phase demixing in the phase inversion process. When the same 3 wt\% PEG was added into the dope solution, the dimension of finger-like macrovoids of the resultant membrane increased in parallel with the increase of PEG molecular weight from 200 to 600 and 6000 kDa, and pure water permeability (PWP) also increased accordingly. An increase in PWP was also observed when PEG-200 loading in the dope solution was increased from 3 to 5 and 10 wt\%, corresponding to the morphology change of resultant membranes.
As a synergetic effect of coagulation temperature with PEG, the finger-like pores occurred in the membrane at room temperature expanded to much larger macrovoids using 10 degrees C water as the coagulant, and the big finger-like pores almost disappeared when the coagulation bath temperature was increased to 40 degrees C because of delayed phase demixing. The big macrovoid size can also be suppressed by adding the second small molecule additive, LiCI, due to its strong interactions with NMP and PVDF-HFP to delay the dope precipitation. The irregular inner contour of the membrane can be eliminated by the increase of coagulation bath temperature to 40 degrees C. The hollow fiber membrane made by a dope of PVDF-HFP/PEG-6000/LiCl/NMP (15/3/3/79 in weight) using 40 degrees C water as the coagulant exhibited a high PWP of 117 L/m(2) h atm and reasonably good MWCO of 150 kDa. An improvement has been made in the current work as compared to previous PVDF-HFP hollow fiber membranes reported in literatures. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Forward osmosis (FO) has received intensive studies recently for a range of potential applications such as wastewater treatment, water purification and seawater desalination. One of the major challenges to be overcome is the lack of an optimized FO membrane that can produce a high water flux comparable to commercial RO membranes. Two types of thin-film composite FO hollow fibers with an ultra-thin polyamide-based RO-like skin layer (300–600 nm) on either the outer surface (\#A-FO) or inner surface (\#B-FO) of a porous hollow fiber substrate have been successfully fabricated. These novel composite FO hollow fibers have been characterized by a series of standard protocols and benchmarked against commercially available FO flat sheet membranes and reported NF hollow fibers used for the FO process. The characterization reveals that the FO hollow fiber membranes possess a large lumen. The substrates are highly porous with a narrow pore size distribution. The active layers present excellent intrinsic separation properties with a hydrophilic rejection layer and good mechanical strength. The \#B-FO hollow fiber membrane can achieve a high FO water flux of 32.2 L/m2 h using a 0.5 M NaCl draw solution in the active rejection layer facing draw solution (AL-facing-DS) configuration at 23 °C. The corresponding salt flux is only 3.7 g/m2 h. To the best of our knowledge, the performance of the \#B-FO hollow fiber is superior to all FO membranes reported in the open literature. The current study suggests that the optimal FO membrane structure would possess a very small portion of sponge-like layer in a thin and highly porous substrate, which suggests a way for further improvement.},

This paper describes the characteristics and potential applications of a newly developed FO hollow fiber membrane, which was fabricated by interfacial polymerization on the inner surface of a polyethersulfone (PES) hollow fiber. This FO membrane presents excellent intrinsic separation properties, with a water flux of 42.6 L/m2 h using 0.5 M NaCl as the draw solution and DI water as the feed with the active layer facing the draw solution orientation at 23 °C. The corresponding ratio of salt flux to water flux was only 0.094 g/L, which is superior to all other FO membranes reported in the open literature. To evaluate different application scenarios, various NaCl solutions (500 ppm (8.6 mM), 1 wt.\% (0.17 M) and 3.5 wt.\% (0.59 M)) were used as the feed water to test the performance of the FO membrane. The membrane can achieve a water flux of 12.4 L/m2 h with 3.5 wt.\% NaCl solution as the feed and 2 M NaCl as the draw solution, suggesting it has good potential for seawater desalination.},

	abstract = {Hollow fiber membranes with a positively charged nanofiltration (NF)-like selective layer have been successfully fabricated by utilizing asymmetric microporous hollow fibers made of Torlon® polyamide–imide (PAI) material as the porous substrate followed by polyelectrolyte post-treatment using polyethyleneimine (PEI), which has not been reported previously. The reaction between PAI and PEI has been confirmed by experiments. The membrane structure and surface property are carefully tailored by adjusting polymer dope composition, spinning conditions and the post-treatment parameters. These membranes are, subsequently, characterized by a series of standard protocols in terms of membrane morphology, structure, permeability and salt rejection, and are applied in forward osmosis (FO) processes. The newly developed PAI hollow fiber membranes show a pure water permeability of 2.19–2.25 L/m2 h bar and reasonable NaCl and MgCl2 rejections of 49\% and 94\% at 1 bar, respectively. It is also found that in FO processes, when using 0.5 M MgCl2 as a draw solution and DI water as the feed in the active layer facing feed water (AL-facing-FW) configuration at 23 °C, the water fluxes of two PAI FO hollow fiber membranes are 8.36 and 9.74 L/m2 h, respectively, and the JS/JV of the two membranes is smaller than 0.4 g/L, which is lower than the data of 0.85 g/L for commercial FO membrane from Hydration Technologies Inc. (HTI). Different from a neutral membrane, the positively charged FO membrane provides double electric repulsions to the salt transfer through the membrane in the AL-facing-FW configuration, leading to a reduction of salt penetration, while in the active layer facing draw solution (AL-facing-DS) configuration, the positive charges facilitate salt transportation. This study provides a simple and effective approach to make hollow fibers suitable for FO applications.},

Recent developments suggest that double-skinned FO membranes may perform superiorly over conventional single-skinned ones. In this design, a dense rejection skin facing the draw solution is responsible for the separation, while a second skin facing the feed solution is designed to prevent foulants entering into the porous support layer sandwiched between the two skins. For the first time, an analytical model is developed for double-skinned FO membranes and is verified experimentally. Model simulations suggest that an optimal double-skinned membrane shall have a feed skin similar to that of a low rejection nanofiltration membrane to minimize the overall hydraulic resistant and to reduce internal concentration polarization. On the other hand, the optimization of the draw skin calls for a compromise between its water permeability and solute rejection. FO water flux is greater for support layers with higher mass transfer coefficients. In addition, it decreases with decreasing draw solution concentration and increasing feed solution concentration. While membrane orientation plays an important role for applications with low feed solution concentrations (with the denser skin preferentially facing the draw solution), this effect becomes negligible at high feed solution concentrations.},

Experimental results revealed that the substrate surface structure is very important for fabricating a RO-like thin film. A substrate with {\textless}300 kDa MWCO is preferred to obtain a good semipermeable skin based on current study. It may not be appropriate to use DI water and a low concentration draw solution (i.e., an ideal situation) to evaluate the FO membrane, as the water permeation through the RO-like skin is the rate-determining step, and the effect of the substrate structure cannot be fully reflected in this ideal situation. In addition, the surface structure of the FO membrane facing the feed is critical as it is directly associated with the tendency of FO membrane fouling, and a relatively dense membrane substrate surface is desirable in the membrane orientation of active layer facing draw solution. An ideal FO membrane should also possess anti-fouling capability or less fouling propensity in addition to high water permeability, low salt permeability and minimized structural parameter.},

A competent membrane for PRO should possess the features of high water permeability to allow water permeation, excellent salt rejection to maintain the osmotic driving force, low structure parameter to minimize the internal concentration polarization (ICP), and robust strength to withstand the required hydraulic pressure. In this work, we have developed a novel hollow fiber membrane by balancing these competing factors based on our prior experience in the thin-film composite (TFC) membranes. The newly developed TFC hollow fiber membrane can achieve a power density of 20.9 W/m2 at a pressure of 15 bar, using synthetic seawater brine (1.0 M NaCl) as the draw solution and synthetic river water (1 mM NaCl) as the feed water, respectively. The simultaneous specific reverse salt flux was found to be 0.03 mol/L, which is much lower than reported flat-sheet membranes, as the self-supported hollow fiber membrane can eliminate the deformation-enhanced reverse salt diffusion that is typical for flat-sheet membranes. However it was observed that the water permeability and structure parameter of the TFC hollow fiber membrane varied noticeably corresponding to the change in the hydraulic pressure imposed in the fiber lumen. Over a certain range (ΔP\&lt;15 bar), such variations of increasing A value and decreasing S value proved to have positive impacts, as they facilitate the water permeation and reduce the ICP in the PRO process.},

The membrane fabrication method is similar to that used for making thin-film composite (TFC) forward osmosis hollow fiber membranes, but further optimization and improvement have led to a new type of TFC hollow fiber membranes with much greater mechanical strength in addition to its excellent separation property and high water flux. The TFC PRO hollow fiber membranes have a water permeability (A) of 9.22 × 10−12 m/(s Pa), salt permeability (B) of 3.86 × 10−8 m/s and structural parameter (S) of 4.6 × 10−4 m. It can withstand hydrostatic pressure as high as 9 bar with its relatively large dimension of 0.98 mm lumen diameter. This PRO hollow fiber membrane is superior to all other PRO membranes reported in the open literature in terms of power density. A power density as high as 10.6 W/m2 can be achieved using seawater brine (1.0 M NaCl) and wastewater brine (40 mM NaCl), which suggests that the newly developed PRO hollow fiber membrane has great potential to be applied in PRO processes to harvest salinity gradient energy. A higher pressure is preferred as it allows generation of higher power density (pressures of 12 bar may be optimal for seawater as the high salinity stream), and this can be realized by reduced fiber dimension. Further optimization of the membrane structure will be performed.},

	abstract = {Pressure retarded osmosis (PRO) is a promising technology for extracting renewable salinity-gradient energy. However, its performance can be significantly influenced by membrane deformation at the high applied pressures when feed spacers are used in the operation. This study systematically investigated the effect of feed spacer geometry on membrane deformation and the resulted PRO performance. It was observed that feed spacers with larger openings induced more severe membrane deformation at higher applied pressures. A theoretical mechanical model further reveals that the extent of membrane deformation is proportional to the applied pressure and the square of the opening size of the feed spacer and inversely proportional to the membrane mechanical strength. Moreover, a modified RO method was developed to measure the separation properties (i.e., the water permeability (A value), solute permeability (B value) and solute/water selectivity (B/A value)) of the deformed membrane. The measured A, B and B/A values increased with the extent of the membrane deformation. It was further found that the severe membrane deformation not only drastically reduced the PRO water fluxes but also substantially increased the hydraulic pressure loss in the feed flow channel. For feed spacers with large openings, the reduced PRO water fluxes together with the increased pumping need for feed flow severely decreased the net power output. In contrast, the use of feed spacers with small openings resulted in significant improvement of PRO performance. In the current study, the use of commercial RO permeate carrier as the PRO feed spacer (opening ratio {\textasciitilde}0.35) lead to a significantly enhanced power density of 5.8 W/m2 at the optimal applied pressure of 17.2 bar due to the minimized membrane deformation. The current study can provide important implications for PRO studies.},

The PRO performance was improved by decreasing the feed solution concentration, increasing the draw solution concentration, orientating the membrane with active layer facing draw solution (AL-DS), and increasing temperature. The membrane with higher water permeability, lower solute permeability and lower structure parameter performed better in PRO process. However, the experimentally obtained power densities for all the membranes used in this study were lower than the predictions from conventional ICP model that assumes membrane separation parameters are constant in PRO process.

However, the PRO performance (both water flux and power density) can be significantly limited by membrane fouling. This study, for the first time, systematically investigated membrane fouling by organic foulants in PRO process and its effect on PRO power density. It was found that significant alginate fouling occurred when the draw solution (DS) contained large quantities of divalent cations (i.e., Ca2+ and/or Mg2+). This is attributed to the reverse solute diffusion enhanced organic fouling, the effect of which is related to (1) the type of draw solute and the rate of its diffusion into the feed solution (FS), and (2) its ability to interact with feed foulant. It was also found that the increase of DS concentration exacerbated the PRO fouling due to the synergistic effects of increased reverse solute diffusion and increased initial water flux level. However, the increase of applied hydraulic pressure mitigated the alginate fouling for NaCl draw solution but exacerbated the alginate fouling for CaCl2 draw solution due to the competing effects between the increased reverse solute diffusion and the reduced initial water flux. It was further found that the alginate fouling was more severe under PRO operation than that under forward osmosis (FO) operation at an identical initial water flux level using seawater-based DSs due to the faster reverse solute diffusion under PRO operation.

This study investigated the influence of membrane orientation and organic fouling on the performance of FO membrane in removing boron and arsenic. Results of laboratory-scale crossflow membrane filtration experiments showed that the inorganic contaminants were rejected at a much lower rate when membrane active layer was facing draw solution (AL-DS) compared to the active layer-facing feed water (AL-FW) orientation, as a result of the more severe concentrative internal concentration polarization (ICP) in the latter orientation. The difference in boron rejection between the two membrane orientations was greater due to its higher permeability through the FO membrane. In the AL-FW orientation, the formation of an alginate fouling layer on the membrane surface could enhance the sieving effect and thus improve the rejection of arsenious acid with relatively larger molecular size. In the AL-DS orientation, alginate fouling in the membrane support layer had adverse effect on boron rejection at water flux below 4.2 μm/s (15.3 L/m2/h), attributed to the foulant enhanced concentrative ICP effect.

	abstract = {Forward osmosis (FO) is attracting increasing interest for its potential applications in water and wastewater treatment and desalination. One of the major drawbacks of FO is internal concentration polarization (ICP), which significantly limits the FO flux efficiency. In addition, FO membrane flux can be adversely affected by membrane fouling. The effects of ICP and fouling on FO flux behavior were systematically investigated in the current study. Both theoretical model and experimental results demonstrated that the FO flux was highly non-linear with respect to the apparent driving force (the concentration difference between the draw solution and the feed water) as a result of ICP. ICP played a dominant role on FO flux behavior at greater draw solution concentrations and/or greater membrane fluxes due to the exponential dependence of ICP on flux level. Compared to the active layer facing draw solution (AL-facing-DS) configuration, more severe ICP was observed when the membrane active layer faced the feed water (AL-facing-FW) as a result of dilutive ICP in the FO support layer. Interestingly, the AL-facing-FW configuration showed remarkable flux stability against both dilution of the bulk draw solution and membrane fouling. In this configuration, any attempt to reduce membrane flux was compensated by a reduced level of ICP. The net result was only a marginal flux reduction. In addition, foulant deposition was insignificant in this configuration. Thus, the AL-facing-FW configuration enjoyed inherently stable flux, however, at the expense of severer initial ICP. In contrast, the AL-facing-DS configuration suffered severe flux reduction as porous membrane support faced the humic acid containing feed water. The flux loss in this configuration was likely due to the combined effects of (1) the internal clogging of the FO support structure as well as (2) the resulting enhanced ICP in the support layer. The latter was caused by reduced porosity and reduced mass transfer coefficient of the support. The pore clogging enhanced ICP mechanism probably played a dominant role in FO flux reduction at higher flux levels. To the authors’ best knowledge, this is the first study to systematically demonstrate the coupled effects of ICP and fouling on the FO flux behavior.},

At the same water flux level (achieved by adjusting the draw solution concentration), the greatest reverse solute diffusion rate was observed for NaCl draw solution, followed by Ca(NO3)2 draw solution, and then CaCl2 draw solution and MgCl2 draw solution, the order of which was consistent with that of their solute permeability coefficients. Moreover, the reverse solute diffusion of draw solute (especially divalent cation) can change the feed solution chemistry and thus enhance membrane fouling by alginate, the extent of which is related to the rate of the reverse draw solute diffusion and its ability to interact with the foulant. The extent of fouling for the four types of draw solution followed an order of Ca(NO3)2 \&gt; CaCl2 \&gt;\&gt; MgCl2 \&gt; NaCl. On the other hand, the rate of forward diffusion of feed solute (e.g., Na+) was in turn promoted under severe membrane fouling in active layer facing draw solution orientation, which may be attributed to the fouling enhanced concentration polarization (pore clogging enhanced ICP and cake enhanced concentration polarization). The enhanced concentration polarization can lead to additional water flux reduction and is an important mechanism governing the water flux behavior during FO membrane fouling. Findings have significant implications for the draw solution selection and membrane fouling control in osmotically driven membrane processes.},

	abstract = {Delamination-free ultrafiltration (UF) dual layer hollow fibers have been successfully fabricated by dry jet-wet spinning technique. Two different polymers of poly(amide-imide) (PAI) and polyethersulfone (PES) were utilized as the selective layer on the outer side and the porous support layer on the inner side, respectively. The dual layer substrates were subsequently modified to develop a nanofiltration (NF)-like skin on the outer layer by polyethyleneimine (PEI) cross-linking followed by multilayer polyelectrolyte depositions. These membranes were characterized by a series of standard protocols in terms of membrane structure, permeability and salt rejection, and were applied in FO process. Experiments reveal that the dual-layer NF hollow fiber modified by polyelectrolyte cross-linking and depositions can achieve pure water permeability of 4.1 l/m2.h.bar and a high rejection to MgCl2 up to 97\%. In FO process, the dual-layer hollow fibers exhibited a water flux of 39 and 21 l m− 2 h− 1 in the orientations of active layer facing draw solution and feed water, respectively, by using 0.5 M MgCl2 as draw solution and de-ionized (DI) water as feed at room temperature. It suggests that the combined treatment of polyelectrolyte cross-linking and deposition is an effective way to form a NF-like selective layer for FO dual-layer hollow fiber membranes.},

	abstract = {Dual layer hollow fiber membranes have become increasingly attractive due to their many benefits made possible by one-step fabrication using the non-solvent induced phase inversion method. Obtaining a good lamination between the two layers as well as a regular morphology are critical to make a usable hollow fiber membrane. This study aims to explore the mechanism of the lamination/delamination phenomenon and regular/irregular morphology that can occur in the fabrication of dual layer hollow fiber membrane. Simultaneous extrusion of poly(amide-imide) and polyethersulfone (PES) dope solutions was carried out by using a triple orifice spinneret. Thermodynamic properties and phase separation kinetics of the polymer dopes as well as various spinning parameters were carefully tailored in order to investigate the evolution of the membrane morphology and structure. A series of experiments have confirmed that when the external coagulant, water, has a higher diffusion rate in the outer layer than in the inner layer, the outer layer tends to expand to form large macrovoids and to hold more water at the interface. As a result, the accumulated water probably impedes the adhesion of the two layers, leading to a delamination of two layers. On the other hand, if water has a slower penetration rate through the outer layer dope than the inner layer dope, a good adhesion between these two layers is expected. Under this scenario, since macrovoids formed in the inner layer may lead to the expansion of the inner layer, a distortion of the finger-like structure/macrovoids in the inner and an irregularity of the inner contour may occur. This study provides a solid foundation to develop superior dual layer hollow fiber membranes with an inter-penetrating dual layer structure.},

In order to develop a novel hydrophobic membrane that can be used in membrane contactors, a hydrophobic surface modification method for Torlon® polyamide-imide (PAI) membrane was explored, which has not been reported previously. Asymmetric microporous hollow fiber membranes were fabricated using PAI material followed by a simple surface modification using a silane coupling agent, 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS), and a perfluro-compound (Fluorolink S10) to produce PAI hollow fiber membranes with a hydrophobic surface. The reactions between PAI and the modification reagents have been confirmed by experiments. Optimal modification conditions were investigated by varying the modification parameters, such as APTMS treatment temperature, APTMS concentration, APTMS treatment time, and Fluorolink S10 treatment time. The modified PAI membranes were, subsequently, characterized by a series of standard protocols in terms of membrane morphology, chemical structure, contact angle, porosity and critical water entry pressure. A preliminary study of using the modified membranes in a membrane contactor for CO2 absorption was also carried out. The newly developed PAI hollow fiber membranes showed much higher hydrophobicity, the contact angle was improved from 76° to 108–117° and the critical water entry pressure was improved from 0.7–0.8 bar to 2.1–4.0 bar. Moreover, the modified PAI hollow fiber membranes showed reasonably high CO2 flux by using water as a physical absorption liquid. The results indicate that the modified PAI membranes have great potential to be used in membrane contactor applications.},

	abstract = {In a gas-liquid membrane contactor, a larger pore size can result in a lower membrane mass transfer resistance. However, the membrane pore size is usually limited by the concern of pore wetting, e.g. a large pore size means a higher wetting tendency. As a breakthrough, this paper reported a porous polyetherimide (PEI) hollow fiber membrane with high surface porosity and large pore size to minimize the membrane mass transfer resistance by using a triple-orifice spinneret in the hollow fiber spinning process, and followed by a novel approach of fluorinated silica (fSiO2) nanoparticles (NPs) incorporation to make the membrane surface highly hydrophobic and chemical resistant to prevent the membrane from wetting caused by the large pore size on the membrane surface. The newly developed composite hollow fiber membranes showed the advancing contact angle value of 123.3°, receding contact angle value of 107.2°, and contact angle hysteresis of only 15.9°, indicating the high water resistant property. The composite membrane also exhibited a higher rigidity property compared with original PEI substrate. The CO2 absorption flux of the composite membranes was investigated in both physical and chemical absorptions in a gas-liquid membrane contactor system. The membrane contactor showed a stable performance throughout the 60-day long-term operation using a 2 M sodium taurinate aqueous solution as the liquid absorbent. The highly hydrophobic composite hollow fiber membrane was able to outperform conventional polymeric hydrophobic membrane in term of superior gas absorption flux and outstanding long-term stability, suggesting that the formation of organic-inorganic composite membranes is an effective way to enhance the feasibility of membrane contactor processes for practical applications. The results demonstrated the important role of membrane fabrication and modification techniques in facilitating the commercialization of membrane contactor technology.},

	abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a greenhouse gas found primarily as a main combustion product of fossil fuel as well as a component in natural gas, biogas and landfill gas. The interest to remove CO2 from those gas streams to obtain fuel with enhanced energy content and prevent corrosion problems in the gas transportation system, in addition to CO2 implications to the climate change, has driven the development of CO2 separation process technology. One type of technology which has experienced substantial growth, breakthroughs and advances during past decades is membrane-based technology. The attractive features offered by this technology include high energy efficiency, simplicity in design and construction of membrane modules and environmental compatibility. The objective of this review is to overview the different types of membranes available for use including their working principles, current status and development which form the primary determinants of separation performance and efficiency. The emphasis is toward CO2/CH4 separation, considering its substantial and direct relevance to the gas industry. To this end, discussion is made to cover polymeric gas permeation membranes; CO2-selective facilitated transport membranes, hollow fiber gas–liquid membrane contactors, inorganic membranes and mixed matrix membranes. The market for CO2 separation is currently dominated by polymeric membranes due to their relatively low manufacturing cost and processing ability into flat sheet and hollow fiber configurations as well as well-documented research studies. While there have been immensely successful membrane preparation and development techniques with consequential remarkable performance for each type of membrane. Each type of membrane brings associated advantages and drawbacks related to the characteristic transport mechanism for specific application conditions. Inorganic membranes, for example, are very suitable for high temperature CO2 separation in excess of 400 °C while all other membranes can be applied at lower temperatures. The recent emergence of mixed matrix membranes has allowed the innovative approach to combine the advantages offered by inorganic and polymeric materials.},

	abstract = {Hydrophobic surface can be produced by either lowering the surface free energy or enhancing the surface roughness or a combination of both. This study explored a novel method to form a highly hydrophobic organic–inorganic composite hollow fiber membrane by incorporating the fluorinated silica (fSiO2) inorganic layer on the polyetherimide (PEI) organic substrate. The formation of the composite membrane was examined and confirmed by ATR-FTIR, TGA and SEM. Ultrasonication test was conducted to examine the structural stability of the composite membrane. The experimental results revealed that the fSiO2 layer was tightly bonded to the PEI substrate through silane chemical reactions. The incorporation of the fSiO2 layer on the membrane surface could enhance the surface roughness and greatly reduce the surface free energy due to the hydrophobic compound perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane (PFTS). The hydrophobicity of the composite membrane surface was dramatically elevated, as evidenced by the dynamic contact angles increment, e.g. from original 66.7° to 124.8° for advancing values, and from 49.5° to 100.6° for receding values. In addition, it was observed the mechanical property of the composite membrane was better than some of the conventional polymeric membranes such as polyethersulfone (PES), and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). The composite membrane was also not as brittle as the pure inorganic membrane. Highly hydrophobic membrane is the core element in gas–liquid membrane contactor and the newly developed PEI-fSiO2 composite hollow fiber membranes were intended for the use in such application. The CO2 absorption flux of the composite membranes was investigated in both physical and chemical absorptions in a gas–liquid membrane contactor system. Moreover, the membrane contactor showed a reasonably stable performance throughout the 31 days long-term operation using a 2 M sodium taurinate aqueous solution as the liquid absorbent and pure CO2 as the feed gas. The chemical compatibility test indicated that after the long-term constant contact with the sodium taurinate, the hydrophobicity of the PEI-fSiO2 composite membrane still maintained and was much higher than that of original PEI substrate and conventional hydrophobic polymeric membranes such as PVDF. The incorporation of the fSiO2 inorganic layer not only offered high hydrophobicity, but also would protect the polymeric substrate from the attacks of chemical absorbents, making the membrane a longer lifespan.},

The modification mechanism was confirmed by ATR-FTIR, and the effect of different modification times on the modified membrane properties was investigated. Experiments reveal that the modification changed the membrane morphology and structure, resulted in surface pore opening and thinning down of the membrane skin layer. As a compromise between the membrane hydrophobicity and mechanical strength, 10–30 min were considered as appropriate modification times for the PAI membranes. The treated membranes showed much higher hydrophobicity with an improvement in contact angle of around 30°. The liquid entry pressure (LEPw) also increased dramatically from 7 psi to 63 psi after 30 min modification due to the enhanced membrane hydrophobicity. The treated membranes were tested in the membrane contactor for CO2 absorption. It was observed the CO2 flux increased with the liquid velocity and modification time. A stable long-term performance of CO2 absorption by a 2 M sodium taurinate aqueous solution for 15 days of operation was attained. Moreover, poly(etherimide) (PEI) hollow fiber membranes were successfully modified by octadecylamine, which demonstrated the effectiveness and versatility of the modification method on imide-contained polymeric membranes.},

	abstract = {Composite nanofiltration (NF) hollow fiber membranes desirable for water softening under low operating pressure (\&lt;2 bar) were successfully developed in the current study. The thin-film selective layer of the composite hollow fiber was formed through interfacial polymerization on the inner surface of a polyethersulfone (PES) ultrafiltration (UF) membrane substrate with branched polyethyleneimine (PEI) and trymesoyl chloride (TMC) employed as the monomers in aqueous and organic phases, respectively. It is found that a proper molecular weight of PEI and the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in the aqueous phase are important for a successful interfacial polymerization reaction. The resulting membrane prepared with optimized preparation parameters possesses a positively charged thin-film selective layer with pure water permeability (PWP) of about 17 l/m2 h bar and a molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) of around 500 Da, which translates into the effective pore diameter of about 1.29 nm. With combined separation mechanisms of Donnan exclusion and steric hindrance, it was possible to achieve MgCl2 and MgSO4 rejection of 96.7\% and 80.6\%, respectively, when tested for 1000 ppm feed solutions at 2 bar operating pressure. In addition, for a 3000 ppm TDS feed stream containing salt mixtures, the membrane rejections for Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions were found to be around 90\% while the water flux was about 20 l/m2 h at 2 bar pressure, suggesting the potential of the newly developed composite hollow fibers for effective water softening application.},

	abstract = {In order to understand the membrane wetting in microporous hollow fiber membrane contactors, a theoretical model was developed by simulating CO2 absorption in water under two extreme operating conditions of the non-wetted and wetted modes. The experimental studies on CO2 absorption using an aqueous DEA solution as the absorbent in a polypropylene hollow fiber membrane contactor were also conducted over a three-month period of time. Simulation results show that the CO2 absorption rate in the non-wetted mode is six times higher than those of the wetted mode of operation. The deteriorated performance in the wetted mode is mainly attributed to the mass transfer resistance imposed by the liquid in the membrane pores. The reduction of overall mass transfer coefficient may reach 20\% even if the membrane pores were 5\% wetted. Experimentally, the CO2 absorption in a 2 M DEA solution was found to be influenced by the gas flow rate significantly and the CO2 flux was enhanced by the increase of CO2 volume fraction in the feed stream. Moreover, in the Celgard microporous hollow fiber MiniModule®, the CO2 flux reduced about 20\% in the initial 4 days of operation and then there was no change in the performance. The membrane wetting was identified to be the main reason responsible for the performance drop, as the membrane morphology and the overall mass transfer coefficient presented corresponding changes. The retrieval of the CO2 flux to 90\% of the original amount was achieved by increasing the gas phase pressure, which further validated this hypothesis. Clearly, the prevention of the membrane wetting is very critical in maintaining the high performance of CO2 absorption in the membrane contactor.},

Crosslinking densities of the membranes were about 25–35\%, with about 3–4 chlorines bound to the repeating unit of the polyamide membranes. This was equivalent to ∼ 39\% of all nitrogens being chlorinated in the polyamide membranes assuming the amide nitrogen is the dominant reaction site with chlorine. FTIR spectra showed the amide I band (CO stretching peak at 1663 cm−1) of polyamide membranes shifted to higher wave-numbers and the peak intensity of the amide II band (NH bending peak at 1541 cm−1) decreased after chlorination. The peak shift and decrease of peak intensity resulted from breakage of hydrogen bonds between CO and NH groups within the polymers. The XPS and FTIR analytical analysis showed that there is no difference in the chlorine attack of polyamide membranes of higher or lower crosslinking density, and that the chlorination breaks and weakens hydrogen bonding. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {This study investigates the effect of hydrodynamic conditions and solution chemistry on protein fouling during ultrafiltration. Drastic flux reduction was observed at high initial flux and/or low cross-flow velocity. A limiting flux existed during BSA filtration, beyond which membrane flux cannot be sustained. Further increase in pressure over the limiting value did not enhance the stable flux. The rate and extent of BSA fouling were also strongly dependent on the feedwater composition, such as BSA concentration, pH, and ionic strength. Foulant concentration had no effect on the stable flux, although the rate approaching to the stable flux increased proportionally with increasing foulant concentration. Fouling was most severe at the isoelectric point of BSA (pH 4.7), where the electrostatic repulsion between foulant molecules is negligible. Membrane fouling became less severe at pHs away from the isoelectric point. Increasing ionic strength at pH 3.0 promoted severe fouling likely due to electric double layer (EDL) compression. On the other hand, the flux behavior was insensitive to salt concentration at pH 4.7 due to the lack of electrostatic interaction. At a solution pH of 5.8, effect of ionic strength on long-term flux behavior was directly opposite to that on the transient behavior. While the long-term flux was lower at higher ionic strength due to EDL compression, the transient behavior was also affected by the BSA retention of the membrane.},

	abstract = {Fouling of NF270, NF90 and XLE membranes by macromolecules, represented by three model protein foulants (lysozyme, Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) and binary protein mixture (BSA-LYZ)), has been examined in this study. Effects of hydrodynamic conditions (initial flux and cross-flow velocity) and feed solution composition (pH, ionic strength and calcium ions) on protein fouling were observed. 
Bench-scale cross-flow test unit was employed with baseline electrolyte of 10mM NaCl (unless otherwise specified) and foulant concentration 20mg/L at constant room temperature (26°C) for the fouling tests. Flux throughout the seven-day fouling experiment was recorded by data-logger to a computer terminal. Mass deposition of fouled membranes was evaluated by UV-absorbance method with UV-Visible Spectrometer at the end of fouling runs. In addition, salt rejection of NF270 membranes was calculated.
From this study, significant flux decline was observed with initial flux higher than limiting flux. Higher pH of feed solution also promised greater flux decline and foulant deposition on NF270 with lysozyme as model foulant. On the other hand, higher ionic strength (100mM) and presence of Calcium (Ca2+) did not have significant impact on flux decline and lysozyme deposition on NF270. However, both seemed to reduce salt rejection of NF270. Under comparison, binary protein mixture (BSA-LYZ) resulted in most severe fouling. Nevertheless, an overall improvement for salt rejection was observed for all three model foulants. Finally, flux decline trends for XLE, NF90 and NF270 were found to converge ultimately which was likely due to foulant-deposited-foulant interactions rather than interactions between foulant and membranes.},

The chemical and physical changes of the membranes were investigated by attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy FTIR-ATR and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The characteristics of the modified membrane were examined in terms of liquid entry pressure of water (LEPw), pore size and pore size distribution, contact angle and mechanical properties. The modified fibers were also used in the membrane contactor system to evaluate their performance for CO2 absorption. FTIR-ATR result showed the enrichment of fluorine and ethoxysilane on the modified PVDF–HFP membranes leading to higher LEPw and contact angle than those of the unmodified membrane by 36\% and 33\%, respectively. The contact angle increased from 95.5° to 127.8°. Compared to the unmodified PVDF–HFP hollow fiber, the cross-sectional morphology and mechanical properties of the modified membrane changed insignificantly, while the membrane mean pore size was reduced from 32.7 nm to 25.2 nm. The CO2 physical absorption performance of the modified fibers was better than the unmodified fibers. The membrane mass transfer coefficients of the unmodified and modified PVDF–HFP hollow fiber were 5.69 × 10−5 and 7.56 × 10−5 m/s, respectively, indicating that the modified membranes have good potential for application in the gas absorption process.},

The effect of solution chemistry, membrane properties, and permeate flux level was systematically studied. When the solution pH was within the isoelectric points (IEPs) of the two proteins (i.e., pH 4.7–10.4), the mixed protein system experienced more severe flux decline compared to the respective single protein systems, which may be attributed to the electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged BSA and positively charged LYS molecules. Unlike a typical single protein system, membrane fouling by BSA–LYS mixture was only weakly dependent on solution pH within this pH range, and increased ionic strength was found to enhance the membrane flux as a result of the suppressed BSA–LYS electrostatic attraction. Membrane fouling was likely controlled by foulant–fouled-membrane interaction under severe fouling conditions (elevated flux level and unfavorable solution chemistry that promotes fouling), whereas it was likely dominated by foulant–clean-membrane interaction under mild fouling conditions. Compared to nonporous NF and RO membranes, the porous UF membrane was more susceptible to dramatic flux decline due to the increased risk of membrane pore plugging. This study reveals that membrane fouling by mixed macromolecules may behave very differently from that by typical single foulant system, especially when the inter-foulant-species interaction dominates over the intra-species interaction in the mixed foulant system.},

The initial flux behavior was highly dependent on membrane properties, where membranes with smoother and more hydrophilic surface and those with favorable electrostatic repulsion experienced less initial fouling. Interestingly, the flux at the end of the 4-day tests (J96h) showed little dependence on membrane properties, with reverse osmosis, nanofiltration, and ultrafiltration membrane fluxes all converged into a nearly identical value. This suggests that the long-term flux was primarily controlled by the foulant–fouled-membrane surface interaction. Membranes tested at different initial fluxes had a strong tendency to approach to a surface-interaction-limited value, although slightly lower J96h was observed at increased applied pressure, likely due to foulant layer compaction. BSA fouling was more severe at pHs close to its isoelectric point (IEP), at high ionic strength and in the presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+ as a result of reduced electrostatic repulsion or the promotion of specific ion interactions under these conditions. A linear correlation was observed between J96h and the square of zeta potential of BSA (ζ2), suggesting that ζ2 can be potentially a good indicator for predicting the long term fouling behavior.},

In this study, a systematical study has been carried out to investigate the effect of Pluronics with different molecular architectures and contents as a pore-forming additive on the fabrication of polyethersulfone (PES) ultrafiltration (UF) hollow fibers, and to identify the most preferential features of Pluronic for making high performance membranes. The as-spun hollow fibers were characterized in terms of cross-sectional membrane morphology, membrane surface chemistry, mechanical properties, pure water permeation (PWP), molecular weight cut-off (MWCO), and pore size distribution. It was observed that the PWP and MWCO of the as-spun hollow fibers are dependent on the structure of additives. Among all the membranes spun with 5 wt\% additives, the hollow fibers spun using Pluronic F127 and F108 as the additives possess the highest PWP, the lowest MWCO, and the narrowest pore size distribution. It is possible that the PEO brush layer formed on the internal pore surface by Pluronic F127 and F108 might reduce the apparent pore size and hence improved the solute rejection of the resultant membranes. A comparison between Pluronic and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as additives also confirmed the importance of the presence of PPO chain in Pluronic in the formation of high-performance membranes. When Pluronic F127 concentration was 10 wt\%, the as-spun hollow fiber exhibited the highest PWP of 113.8 L/m2 h bar and the lowest MWCO of 9 kDa.},

The TFN membranes were characterized and evaluated in comparison with a thin film composite (TFC) membrane. The incorporation of NaY zeolite nanoparticles in the polyamide rejection layer significantly changed its separation properties. In the range of 0.02–0.1 wt./v\% zeolite loading, the incorporation of zeolite-polyamide exhibited enhanced water permeability of membrane likely due to the porous nature of zeolite. However, further increase in zeolite loading led to a reduction in water permeability, possibly as a result of the formation of a thicker polyamide layer. The most permeable TFN membrane (TFN0.1, with 0.1 wt./v\% zeolite loading) had a water permeability approximately 80\% higher compared to the baseline TFC membrane. The FO water flux followed a similar trend to that of the membrane water permeability. Under all cases evaluated in the current study (0.5–2.0 NaCl draw solution, DI water and 10 mM NaCl feed solution, and both membrane orientations), the membrane TFN0.1 exhibited highest water flux (up to 50\% improvement over the TFC membrane).

Process optimization in the bubbling assisted DCMD process was carried out which involved varying operating conditions and module configurations. Also, observations were performed for the scaling status on the membrane surface with operating time in different modules to further understand the role of gas bubbling in affecting the behavior of crystal deposition when the salt concentration has reached super-saturation. Due to intensified local mixing and physical flow disturbance in the liquid boundary layer on the feed side, a higher flux enhancement could be achieved in a bubbling system with either a higher feed operating temperature, lower feed and permeate flow velocities, inclined module orientation, shorter fiber length or lower packing density. It was also found that gas bubbling not only enhanced the permeation flux by average 26\% when concentrating feed solution from 18\% salt concentration to saturation, but also delayed the occurrence of major flux decline due to crystal deposition when compared to the module with spacers. These results were confirmed by membrane surface autopsy at different operating stages using SEM.},

A novel approach was explored to obtain a highly hydrophilic membrane surface via plasma induced grafting of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and subsequent TiO2 particles deposition onto the membrane surface. The mechanism of oil affinity onto a membrane surface was quantitatively investigated by the extended Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek (XDLVO) theory. A series of characterizations were conducted for the virgin and modified membranes. Membrane distillation tests for synthetic seawater containing 0.01 wt\% of mineral oil were also performed to investigate the influences of membrane hydrophobicity, membrane surface structure, pH value of the feed solution and hydrodynamic conditions on oil fouling behavior. The SEM and FTIR measurements confirmed the presence of PEG and TiO2 particles on the PVDF membrane substrate. The hydrophilically modified PVDF-PT membrane exhibits a positive interfacial free energy with oil in the feed, indicating the TiO2 deposition effectively improve the anti-fouling property of PVDF-P membrane and PVDF membrane. It was also found that the PVDF-PT membrane presents a stable water flux over 24 h of operation without fouling and wetting due to combined effects of enhanced surface hydrophilicity and reduced membrane pore sizes. In addition, the pH value of the feed solution plays an important role in oil fouling. More severe fouling can be observed at the pH which made the membrane surface and oil droplets carry opposite charges. Moreover, a higher flow velocity enhances the shear force exerted on the oil droplets, thus leading to less oil present on the membrane surface and less oil fouling of the membrane.},

	abstract = {Recently membrane distillation (MD) has received intensive interests for a range of applications such as desalinations of seawater and brine. One of the major obstacles for MD application is the lack of an optimized MD membrane that can produce a high and stable flux in long-term operation. Two types of superhydrophobic PVDF nanofiber membranes, integrally-modified and surface-modified PVDF membranes, have been successfully fabricated by electro-spinning followed by surface modification, which includes dopamine surface activation, silver nanoparticle deposition and hydrophobic treatment. The modification is convenient because of mild reactions and wide applicability. These novel composite nanofiber membranes have been characterized by a series of measurements and benchmarked against commercial PVDF flat sheet membrane for MD application. The characterizations reveal that the modifications have altered the membrane surface morphology and topology and made the membrane superhydrophobic due to their hierarchical structures. Compared with unmodified membrane, the integrally-modified membrane (I-PVDF) can achieve a high and stable MD water flux of 31.6 L m−2 h−1 using a 3.5 wt\% NaCl as the feed solution while the feed and permeate temperatures were fixed at 333 K and 293 K, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this result is superior to all other PVDF flat-sheet membranes tested under the same or similar conditions, which is believed to be attributed to the open-surface pore structure and thin thickness of the PVDF nanofiber membrane with the aid of electro-spinning. The superhydrophobic nature of the membrane surface brought by the integral modification on all nanofibers renders the membrane anti-wetting property while remaining high water flux.},

Hydrophobic nanofiber membranes possess high hydrophobicity, high surface porosity and adjustable pore sizes and membrane thickness, which make them an attractive candidate as MD membrane. The current study aims to fabricate and optimize polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanofiber membranes for MD application. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), capillary flow porometer, geniometer, a homemade setup for liquid entry pressure (LEP) measurement and direct contact MD (DCMD) setup were used to characterize the resultant nanofiber PVDF membranes. Polymer dope compositions, spinning parameters such as sprayer moving speed and chamber moisture were optimized to examine their effects on pore size distribution of the membranes. Inorganic additives were also added into the dope to improve the electro-spinability of diluted polymer dopes in order to further decrease membrane pore size. Meanwhile, a heat-press post-treatment was considered as a necessary step to improve fresh nanofiber membrane integrity, enhance water permeation flux and help prevent membrane pores from wetting in DCMD operation. The experiment confirmed that all the electrospun membranes exhibit a rough surface with high hydrophobicity (\&gt;135° water contact angle). The post-treated PVDF nanofiber membranes were able to present a steady water permeation flux of about 21 kg m−2 h−1 throughout the entire testing period of 15 h, using a 3.5 wt\% NaCl solution as the feed under the feed and permeate inlet temperatures of 323 K and 293 K, respectively. This result was better than these of commercial PVDF membranes and the nanofiber PVDF-clay membrane reported in literature, suggesting the competency of PVDF nanofiber membranes for DCMD applications.},

	abstract = {Abstracts In this study, we explored the feasibility of using electrospun polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanofibers as substrates to make high-performance forward osmosis (FO) membrane. Polyamide thin films were successfully formed via interfacial polymerization directly on two electrospun PVDF nanofiber substrates, ES-1\# and ES-2\#, having different surface properties in terms of pore size and surface roughness. The surface structure, water permeability and salt rejection of resultant thin film composite (TFC) FO membranes were characterized by a series of measurements including SEM image observation, XPS characterization and inherent separation property tests. Experimental results revealed that a denser low permeable polyamide layer was formed on the S1\# substrate with relatively smaller pore sizes (mean pore size: 0.28±0.08 μm; maximum pore size: 0.49±0.16 μm), while a looser polyamide layer with higher water permeability was attained on the S2\# substrate with larger pore size (mean pore size: 0.41±0.01μm; maximum pore size: 0.63±0.04 μm). The difference in polyamide layer structure was believed to be associated with the substrate structure, leading to different cross-linking degrees during the interfacial polymerization. The basic forward osmosis performance of resulting TFC membranes were investigated and a water flux of 30.4 L/m2·h was achieved when the active layer was oriented towards the 1.0 M NaCl draw solution while the ratio of reverse salt flux to water flux was able to be kept as low as 0.21 g/L, suggesting the good potential of electro-spun nanofiber membranes used as substrates for making FO membranes.},

The resulting membranes were evaluated in the forward osmosis (FO) process. The membrane prepared using a 0.62 mg/L of MWCNTs solution shows a pure water permeability of 4.48 L/m2h bar with a MgCl2 rejection of 87.8\% at 1 bar. This is a 44\% enhancement in water permeability without significant compromise on the salt permeability when compared to membranes without MWCNTs. In addition, FO water flux of membranes prepared using 0.31 and 1.25 mg/L of MWCNTs solutions have also been enhanced up to 29\% without compromising the solute flux in the active layer facing feed water orientation using 0.5 M MgCl2 solution as the draw solution and deionized water as the feed water.

	abstract = {The use of additives in the polymer dope solutions is one of the most powerful strategies to control the pore structure of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) membranes for various applications. In present work, the effects of amphiphilic pluronic block copolymer as an additive on PVDF membrane formation has been studied and a membrane formation mechanism involving pluronic has been proposed. The surface tension–concentration curve reveals that no micelles are formed in pluronic/N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solutions while the thermodynamics and kinetics are found to be similar for the systems containing pluronic and polyethylene glycol (PEG), respectively. The membranes prepared with pluronic as the additive exhibit larger surface pore, porosity, and macrovoids than that with PEG, indicating that pluronic has a stronger pore-forming ability. Instead of the commonly used concept of instantaneous or delayed demixing, it is believed that the stronger pore-forming ability of pluronic is caused by the hydrophobic–hydrophobic interaction between pluronic and PVDF that delays the solidification process. Since pluronic is not completely stable in PVDF membrane matrix, the membranes are soaked in 2-propanol (IPA) to purposely wash out pluronic. The loss of pluronic after IPA-treatment causes an increase in water permeation and a decrease in rejection, indicating that the presence of pluronic on the membrane pore surface can narrow down the pore size. By adding lithium chloride as a second additive, the growth of macrovoids is suppressed. Moreover, the resultant membranes exhibit both higher permeability and selectivity.},

The MD bioreactor (MDBR) can remediate this by biologically removing retentate carbohydrates and proteins. However, the inclusion of biomass in the MDBR can result in biofouling and flux decline. The objectives of this work are to determine the effectiveness of the bioprocess in delaying membrane wetting (by removing organics and nutrients) and the significance of the biofouling on flux decline. From this work, the MDBR flux can be maintained at more than 6.8 L/m2 h (8\% lower than the average MD flux) for at least 13 days. The faster flux decline in the MDBR is attributed to the thermal and mass transfer resistance of the biofilm but this can be controlled with periodic membrane cleaning and process optimization. Membrane fouling has been shown to compromise membrane hydrophobicity and accelerate wetting. By lowering the retentate organic and nutrient concentration, the MDBR has successfully delayed wetting by 1.7–3.6 times in this work, reducing the frequency of membrane cleaning and drying. With further process optimization, the MDBR could be a good option for reclamation of industrial wastewater with low volatile organic content and access to waste heat.},

This study has explored the working mechanisms of utilizing gas–liquid two-phase flow to enhance heat transfer and mitigate scaling formation in MD concentration process, based on the quantification of heat-transfer coefficients and local scaling-resistance associated with bubble size properties. With the aid of direct observation and statistical analysis on the bubble characteristics in a specially-designed direct contact MD (DCMD) module, it was found that the bubbles with small mean bubble size and narrow size distribution were preferred for creating even flow distribution, intensifying mixing and enhancing surface shear rate. Compared to non-bubbling DCMD, the heat-transfer coefficient and temperature polarization coefficient (TPC) reached up to 2.30- and 2.13-fold, respectively, at an optimal gas flowrate of 0.2 L min−1. With the theoretical expressions for local scaling resistance derived based on the resistance-in-series model, the relative permeation flux (Jw/o{\textbar}t=t1/Jw/o{\textbar}t=0) in non-bubbling MD was quantified and found to rapidly decline by 65\% as the concentration process progressed, consistent with the increasing trend of the ratio of local scaling resistance to the overall resistance (rfl/rov). Fortunately, the introduction of gas bubbles has shown benefits for supersaturation brine concentrating MD process – remarkably decreased the local-scaling resistance due to bubble-intensified shear stress and enhanced hydrodynamics. Also, the total water removal for the brine concentration process was significantly improved by 131\% and the discharged brine volume was reduced accordingly at appropriately selected gas flow rates. Nevertheless, at inappropriately high gas flowrates, high energy consumption and potential fiber breakage should be avoided.},

	abstract = {With modest temperature demand, low operating pressure, and high solute rejection, membrane distillation (MD) is an attractive option for desalination, waste treatment, and food and pharmaceutical processing. However, large-scale practical applications of MD are still hindered by the absence of effective membranes with high hydrophobicity, high porosity, and adequate mechanical strength, which are important properties for MD permeation fluxes, stable long-term performance, and effective packing in modules without damage. This study describes novel design strategies for highly robust superhydrophobic dual-layer membranes for MD via electrospinning. One of the newly developed membranes comprises a durable and ultrathin 3-dimensional (3D) superhydrophobic skin and porous nanofibrous support whereas another was fabricated by electrospinning 3D superhydrophobic layers on a nonwoven support. These membranes exhibit superhydrophobicity toward distilled water, salty water, oil-in-water emulsion, and beverages, which enables them to be used not only for desalination but also for other processes. The superhydrophobic dual-layer membrane \#3S-N with nanofibrous support has a competitive permeation flux of 24.6 ± 1.2 kg m?2 h?1 in MD (feed and permeate temperate were set as 333 and 293 K, respectively) due to the higher porosity of the nanofibrous scaffold. Meanwhile, the membranes with the nonwoven support exhibit greater mechanical strength due to this support combined with better long-term performance because of the thicker 3D superhydrophobic layers. The morphology, pore size, porosity, mechanical properties, and liquid enter pressure of water of these superhydrophobic composite membranes with two different structures are reported and compared with commercial polyvinylidene fluoride membranes.},

	abstract = {The practical application of membrane distillation (MD) for water purification is hindered by the absence of desirable membranes that can fulfill the special requirements of the MD process. Compared to the membranes fabricated by other methods, nanofiber membranes produced by electrospinning are of great interest due to their high porosity, low tortuosity, large surface pore size, and high surface hydrophobicity. However, the stable performance of the nanofiber membranes in the MD process is still unsatisfactory. Inspired by the unique structure of the lotus leaf, this study aimed to develop a strategy to construct superhydrophobic composite nanofiber membranes with robust superhydrophobicity and high porosity suitable for use in MD. The newly developed membrane consists of a superhydrophobic silica-PVDF composite selective skin formed on a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) porous nanofiber scaffold via electrospinning. This fabrication method could be easily scaled up due to its simple preparation procedures. The effects of silica diameter and concentration on membrane contact angle, sliding angle, and MD performance were investigated thoroughly. For the first time, the direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) tests demonstrate that the newly developed membranes are able to present stable high performance over 50 h of testing time, and the superhydrophobic selective layer exhibits excellent durability in ultrasonic treatment and a continuous DCMD test. It is believed that this novel design strategy has great potential for MD membrane fabrication.},

	abstract = {The concentrated salt solution from reverse osmosis (RO) or other desalination plants is a critical environmental problem that can impact water quality and thereby have economic and social consequences. An integration of a membrane distillation (MD) with a crystallization unit could serve as a potential way to mitigate this problem by having an almost complete water recovery and eliminating the secondary disposal problem. Hence, the continuous membrane distillation crystallization (CMDC) process was studied for a high concentration (close to saturation) feed solution. In addition, the operating conditions were optimized using an orthogonal fractional factorial (OFF) experiment design in order to realize a near zero discharge by varying the flow rates and operating temperatures on both the feed and permeate sides. The results from an L9(34) OFF experiment design indicated that the flow rates on the feed and permeate sides are the principal factors controlling CMDC performance, whereas the temperatures either on the feed or permeate sides are not main factors. The optimal operating parameter values based on four factors and three levels are a flow rate and temperature on the feed side of 0.64 L min−1 and 338 K, respectively, and on the permeate side of 0.35 L min−1 and 303 K, respectively. These operating conditions not only affect the pure water and NaCl solid production, but also the quality of the crystals obtained from the crystallizer. Factors affecting the crystal size distribution were investigated and indicated that the sodium chloride crystals had a narrow size distribution. The feed flow rate and inlet temperature had more influence on the mean crystal size and crystal size distribution, whereas the permeate flow rate and inlet temperature had relatively less effect. Therefore, CMDC operation was found not only to produce a high quality water product but also sodium chloride crystals with a relatively narrow size distribution. These results are beneficial to a better understanding of the CMDC process and improving its performance to realize zero salty water discharge to the environment.},

Both the SEP and SEP-M exhibited excellent dye removal activities, which is for the first time reported as an intriguing property of the SEP. A regeneration scheme for SEP-M was successfully proposed without any loss of dye removal efficiency. Detailed mechanism studies were carried out to elucidate the nature of dye decolorization.

In this study, the LBL deposition was performed at the inner surface of the polyethersulfone (PES) hollow fiber substrate to form composite nanofiltration (NF) membrane. The semi-dynamic deposition procedure was adopted with the aid of syringes. The newly developed inner deposited (id-LBL) membranes were then tested in NF and forward osmosis (FO) applications and the performance were compared with outer surface deposition as well as some literature data. The id-LBL membranes could not only withstand higher operating pressure but also possess superior hardness rejection especially in high concentration mixed salt solutions (more than 95\% rejection to Mg2+ and Ca2+ in a 5000 ppm total dissolved salt (TDS) mixture under 4.8 bar). As for the FO process, with only two layer deposition, the id-LBL membranes also demonstrated significant performance improvement with increased water flux (up to 70 L/m2 h using 0.5 M MgCl2 as draw solution in active layer facing draw solution configuration) and reduced salt leakage (around 0.5 g/m2 h using 1 M MgCl2 draw solution in active layer facing feed water configuration). This study suggests that for hollow fiber substrate, the inner surface is more suitable for the formation of the selective layer via LBL deposition than the outer surface.},

	abstract = {Mixed polyamide-based composite nanofiltraiton (NF) hollow fiber membranes with suitable characteristics for water softening under ultrafiltration (UF)-range low operating pressure were successfully developed. The thin-film selective layer of the composite membrane was formed via interfacial polymerization on the inner surface of a microporous polyethersulfone (PES) hollow fiber substrate with trymesoyl chloride (TMC) being the organic phase monomer, and a mixture of branched polyethyleneimine (PEI) and piperazine (PIP) being the monomers in the aqueous phase. In was found that there was a synergetic effect of PEI and PIP on the formation of the selective layer. The water permeability and salt rejection of the resultant membrane were both enhanced with a small amount of PIP added into the PEI aqueous phase, but dropped quickly with a higher PIP to PEI ratio. The optimized NF membrane possessed a molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) of 380 Da, an effective pore diameter of 1.27 nm, and pure water permeability (PWP) of 18.2 l/m2 h bar. Under an operating pressure of 2 bar, the membrane exhibited rejection of 96.3\% and 93.8\% to 1000 ppm MgCl2 and MgSO4 feed solutions, respectively. The capability of the newly developed membrane for low-pressure water softening was evaluated by employing simulated hard water feed solutions with different ionic compositions and total hardness. By the combining effect of electrostatic repulsion and size exclusion, the mixed PEI/PIP-based composite hollow fiber offered superior water softening performance compared with the membranes made with PEI or PIP alone as the aqueous phase IP monomer.},

	abstract = {The use of nanotechnology in water separation membranes is a promising approach to alleviate the global water crisis. Graphene oxide (GO) with its unique water transport property has exhibited high potential for application in the water treatment processes. In this study, we have designed and fabricated a novel nanofiltration (NF)-like GO surface deposited poly(amide-imide)–polyethyleneimine (PAI–PEI) hollow fiber membrane. The PAI hollow fiber substrate was prepared by phase inversion and modified with PEI to obtain a positively charged membrane surface. The negatively charged GO nanosheets were then electrostatically immobilized onto the membrane surface via an instant dip-coating to form the NF-like selective layer. Our results have shown that the GO nanosheets serve as effective selective barriers and can achieve higher water permeability up to 86\% without compromising membrane selectivity when used to substitute part of the PEI cross-linked selective layer. This is attributed to the smaller hydrodynamic resistance of GO nanosheets and their ability to effectively narrow the pore size distribution. Moreover, shortening of the membrane modification time and better mechanical properties of the GO modified membrane can be attained by avoiding excessive PEI cross-linking. The GO deposition also exhibits good stability when subjected to a backwashing pressure of 100,000 Pa and a cross-flow rate of 600 mL/min, which corresponds to a velocity of 14 cm/s and a Reynolds number of {\textasciitilde}870.

	abstract = {In this study, the glutaraldehyde (GA) crosslinking was adopted in combination of layer-by-layer (LBL) polyelectrolyte deposition to develop a novel hollow fiber NF membrane with low-pressure water softening capability for synthesized hard water containing divalent counterion SO42−. The challenges for the new membrane include (a) the presence of SO42− in the feed water, which tends to deteriorate positively charged NF membrane retention to divalent ions; (b) high salinity feed water up to 10,000 ppm total dissolved salt (TDS); (c) 2 bar operating pressure that requires the membrane to have a good Mg2+/Na+ selectivity and less mass transfer resistance in the substrate; and (d) better separation performance as compared with the state-of-the-art and commercial NF membranes. Based on the membrane characterization results, the possible structure of the deposited layers and the effect of GA crosslink was proposed. It was found that the crosslinking could tighten the membrane surface pores with increased hydrophilicity while the membrane surface charge was reduced. Therefore, mainly based on the size exclusion, the crosslinked LBL*1.5C membrane showed more than 10 LMH/bar permeability with above 95\% rejection to each of 1000 ppm MgCl2, MgSO4 and Na2SO4 solution under 2 bar pressure.

	abstract = {The pressure retarded osmosis (PRO) process is a novel technology which generates green electrical energy via semi-permeable membranes. However, a major challenge in the PRO system is the lack of suitable membranes with satisfactory power density (i.e., the power output per unit membrane area). In this study, we have successfully fabricated a novel thin-film composite (TFC) PRO membrane consisting of a tiered structure of polyetherimide (PEI) nanofibrous support reinforced by functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (f-CNTs) and an ultrathin polyamide-based selective top skin layer. The tiered support was made by a fine and a coarse PEI nanofiber layers. The thin finer fiber reinforced with well dispersed f-CNTs has been found to increase mechanical stability of the polyamide selective layer, allowing the support to withstand high hydraulic pressure in the PRO system. Our optimized membrane can endure a trans-membrane pressure up to 24 bar and generate a peak power density as high as 17.3 W/m2 at 16.9 bar using synthetic seawater brine (1.0 M NaCl) as the draw solution against deionized (DI) water. In addition, the long term PRO result shows that this membrane can generate a stable power density of 15.0±0.5 W/m2 for a test period of 10 h. This demonstrates that our membrane holds great potential to be used in the PRO process.},

	abstract = {Aiming to optimize the system-level heat utilization, a pilot-scale direct contact membrane distillation desalination system integrated with heat recovery (DCMD–HX) was studied using Aspen Plus. An implicit expression of gain output ratio (GOR) was derived to reveal the interplay of heat utilization and process parameters including operating conditions, module specifications as well as membrane properties in the DCMD–HX desalination system. Compared to operating temperatures, the feed/permeate recirculating flowrates were identified as the most influential operational factors affecting the GOR. In the current settings, the maximal GOR of 6.0 was observed at low and equivalent feed- and permeate-side flowrates regardless of module specifications. Low flowrates, however, resulted in undesirable low water productivity, which was consistent with the trade-off relationship observed between the heat utilization efficiency and water recovery rate in MD. Employing membranes with high heat-transfer resistance (low conductivity and thicker membrane wall) helped to improve the GOR up to 32\%. Simulated results also showed that the GOR value increased by 1.3-fold with the preheater parameter ΔTHX varying from 5 to 0 °C. The non-linear scale-up relationship existed between the membrane area and heat utilization (i.e., GOR) was also observed, indicating the possible uncertainty in accurately predicting the GOR value for industrial-scale desalination systems based on lab-scale module testing.},

The corrugation consisted of valleys-and-hills topography, which increased membrane effective surface area (AE) by {\textasciitilde}50\%. It also increased the membrane mean pore size (PS) as a result of changes in formation mechanism. Both higher AE and larger PS increased membrane permeability to about 5–6 times compared to the non-corrugated membrane, prepared under similar conditions.

	abstract = {Nature has contributed the best selective material, Aquaporin (AQP), for us. Herein we report on a highly permeable and selective hollow fiber composite membrane based on Aquaporin Z. The AQP-incorporated proteoliposomes were immobilized on the inner surface of a hollow fiber membrane substrate and subsequently coated by a polyamide layer formed by a non-gas assisted interfacial polymerization process. Morphological observation suggested that the introduced proteoliposomes were totally embedded in the polyamide layer with their intact spherical shape preserved. Hollow fiber composite membranes with different AQP covering densities were prepared and evaluated, and an elevated covering density of AQPs was found beneficial in improving the water flux and salt rejection of the resultant membrane. The biomimetic membrane with a high AQP covering density exhibited a 40 L m−2 h−1 permeate flux at 5 bar, almost 200\% as much as the flux of a typical commercial reverse osmosis membrane (BW30). This membrane also exhibited above 97.5\% rejection to a 500 ppm NaCl solution, which was superior to the commercial membrane tested under the same conditions. Moreover, a forward osmosis test of the AQP-based hollow fiber membrane also yielded a super high water flux without a notable increase in salt back diffusion. It was therefore concluded that the integration between embedded proteoliposomes and the polyamide layer was effectively defect-free, and the remarkably enhanced water permeation was contributed by the embedded AQPs. Furthermore, it was estimated that the newly developed AQP based hollow fiber membrane could reduce the power consumption significantly if applied in a water reclamation process. The AQP-based biomimetic membrane has been designed and fabricated beyond the proof-of-concept stage and is able to offer a novel means for tailoring the membrane materials to enhance membrane performance.},

In this work, thin film composite (TFC) polyetherimide membranes with three different substrate structures were fabricated and characterized. The PRO performance of the resultant membrane was evaluated through two pressure cycle experiments and stability tests. The primary objective of this work is to systematically study PRO membrane's mechanical stability and mass transfer properties under high operating pressures, which determine the power density of the membrane in the PRO process. Experiments revealed that water permeability (Ap) and salt permeability (Bp) under different pressures varied. The Ap and Bp are better indicators for examining the variation of PRO membrane structure under pressure. Within the operating pressure range of 17.2 bar, the top polyamide layer of TFC PEI-2\# membrane mainly experienced a reversible deformation. In the two pressure cycle tests, the water flux, specific salt flux and power density obtained in the upward and downward measurements in each cycle are close to each other. The first cycle and the second cycle also show excellent reproducibility. The membrane was able to maintain almost unchanged water flux and power density of 12.8 W/m2 at 17.2 bar over the 10 h testing time, suggesting the membrane's great potential to be used in practical application in the future.},

This paper combines previous reviews and studies conducted on the individual novel MBRs to discuss the potential in applying these technologies in the removal of targeted organic pollutants from industrial wastewater by providing a summary of the technologies and discussing the research gaps that currently hamper their commercialization. Future research should focus on long-term operation with real industrial wastewaters to identify membrane, operational and biodegradation limitations for further optimization. This includes advances in microbiology and the application of novel membranes to boost the biodegradation and removal capabilities of these novel MBR systems.

The rare-earth Anderson POM ([Gd(H2O)7Cr(OH)6Mo6O18]n) nanoparticles with controllable size and distribution were successfully constructed. Experimental results revealed that the self-assembly was a surface-induced growth process. The silanol groups on the membrane surfaces generated by the (3-aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane pretreatment were essential for the self-assembly process because of the potential hydrogen bonding (OH⋯POMs) and coordination bonding (OHGd) interactions. This work provided a simple but practical method not only for the fabrication of novel POMs-functionalized membranes, but also for the synthesis of POMs nanoarchitectures. In addition, the potential application of the as-prepared POMs-functionalized hollow fiber membranes in degradation of organic pollutant has also been explored. The idea of interfacial membrane contactor has been utilized for the catalytic wet air oxidation of phenol under mild conditions. A three-phase (gas/catalyst/liquid) interface was successfully built up, which enhanced the catalytic efficiency.

The polyethersulfone (PES) hollow fiber substrate was firstly fabricated by a phase inversion method. The RO-like polyamide skin layer was then prepared on the inner surface of the hollow fiber substrate via interfacial polymerization (IP), while the NF-like outer skin layer was prepared via polyelectrolyte layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly. Three double-skinned membranes with negative (DS\#1.5), positive (DS\#2.0) and minimal (DS\#2.5) outer surface charges under neutral pH environment were evaluated for their capabilities against organic fouling in the FO process. The newly developed double-skinned membranes possess water permeability greater than 2 l/m2 h bar and NaCl rejection higher than 95\% under 2 bar pressure, and have superior water flux and less salt leakage than the commercial HTI FO membranes as well as all the reported double-skinned FO membranes with RO-like selective layers. Most importantly, the double-skinned DS\#2.5 hollow fiber membrane exhibits exciting organic fouling resistance because of its highly hydrophilic NF-like secondary layer with minimal surface charge and tightened surface structure to mitigate possible substrate pore clogging and fouling layer formation. A stable water flux of around 25 l/m2 h was attained for DS\#2.5 membrane using {\textless}0.5 M NaCl as the draw solution and a water containing 200 ppm dextran (DEX) or Aldrich humic acid (AHA), or lysozyme (LYS) and 10 mM NaCl as the model feed in the active layer against the draw solution (AL-DS) configuration, suggesting its great potential for practical FO applications.},

	abstract = {One of the big challenges for forward osmosis (FO) practical application is the lack of high performance FO membranes. In this research, we successfully fabricated a novel thin film nanocomposite (TFN) FO membrane consisting of a polyetherimide (PEI) nanofibrous substrate reinforced by functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (f-CNTs) and an ultrathin polyamide rejection layer. In addition to the superior inter-connected porous structure of nanofibrous substrate, the well-distributed f-CNTs in the nanofibers increased the substrate porosity by 18\% and reduced membrane's structural parameter (S value) by 30\%, and significantly improved the substrate tensile modulus by 53\%. The high mechanical strength provided by the embedded f-CNTs enabled us to further increase the substrate pore size and porosity in order to mitigate the internal concentration polarization (ICP). This was demonstrated by the high performance TFN-2 FO membrane with a structural parameter of 310 μm. Its water flux at 1.0 M NaCl draw solution (DS) was as high as 61 and 33 L/m2 h in the active layer facing draw solution (AL-DS) and active layer facing feed water (AL-FW) orientations, respectively, indicating the success of the design strategy, i.e., improved membrane mechanical strength enables a further improvement of the membrane structure to mitigate the ICP.},

	abstract = {Membrane processes have been widely used for water purification because of their high stability, efficiency, low energy requirement and ease of operation. Traditional desalting membranes are mostly dense polymeric films with a “trade off” effect between permeability and selectivity. Biological membranes, on the other hand, can perform transport in some cases with exceptional flux and rejection properties. In particular the discovery of selective water channel proteins – aquaporins – has prompted interest in using these proteins as building blocks for new types of membranes. The major challenge in developing an aquaporin-based membrane technology stems from the fact that the aquaporin protein spans a membrane only a few nanometers thick. Such ultrathin membranes will not be able to withstand any substantial pressures, nor being industrially scalable without supporting structures. Incorporating aquaporin proteins into compatible materials, while ensuring membrane performance, scalability, and cost-effective production, is crucial for a successful technology development. Since the first suggestions for using aquaporins in membrane technology appeared around ten years ago, two main approaches have been suggested based on planar membranes and vesicles respectively. Here we summarize the essentials of aquaporin protein function and review the latest progress in this fascinating area of membrane research and development.},

Specifically, the gas industry in Qatar is challenged to minimize the produced/process water (PPW) volumes injected into disposal wells to ensure long term sustainability of the reservoirs. This research evaluated a novel application of forward osmosis (FO) to reduce the volumes of PPW disposed of by deep well injection using brine from thermal desalination plants or seawater as draw solutions. In the case of brines, this process also provides some environmentally beneficial dilution before discharge. In order to verify the PPW volume reduction concept, bench-scale FO experiments were carried out using commercial flat sheet membranes. FO performance was evaluated using PPW with and without pretreatment and results confirm that pretreatment is key to the successful implementation of FO for the treatment of PPW. Experimental results indicate that FO is effective in achieving 50\% volume reduction of pretreated PPW with stable flux of 12 LMH. Lab analyses show that the TOC in the diluted draw solution was below the detection limit indicating that the TOC from the feed did not appear in the draw solution and hence would not be discharged to the environment.},

The membrane fouling tendencies were compared among five different experimental parameters, namely, GAC size, GAC packing amount, hollow fibre spacing, filtration/idle duration, and fluidization/idle duration. The results indicate that larger-sized GAC particles, higher packing amounts and a ratio of hollow fibre spacing to fluidized particle size of approximately 3-5 are most beneficial for fouling control. Unexpectedly, the intermittent filtration (under continuous fluidization) could not further alleviate membrane fouling compared to continuous filtration, possibly due to inefficient interaction of fluidized GAC particles with membrane surface in absence of permeate driving force. To lower energy consumption, the optimization of intermittent fluidization (under continuous filtration) was performed. Results indicate that the nature of the cake layer formed during non-fluidization period determined the membrane fouling development rather than the fluidization time span. Finally, by comparing the membrane permeability, sodium alginate rejection rate, and membrane properties before and after GAC abrasion, the GAC scouring on membrane integrity was negligible.},

	abstract = {The utilization of osmosis for engineered applications sparked off various emerging technologies relying on osmotically driven membrane processes (ODMPs). Represented by forward osmosis (FO) and pressure retarded osmosis (PRO), ODMPs show great promise to leverage the global water-energy nexus and have drawn considerable attention in recent years. However, their performance in practical applications is significantly affected by membrane fouling. Membrane fouling is a complex problem and is associated with the foulant deposition, concentration polarization and reverse solute diffusion (RSD) in ODMPs. The current paper provides a comprehensive review on membrane fouling in ODMPs with a focus on the elaboration of the factors and mechanisms governing the fouling behavior. Among those fouling factors and mechanisms, some are also applicable for pressure-driven membrane processes (e.g., reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration (NF)), such as the effects of hydrodynamic conditions, feedwater composition, and membrane material and properties, and the cake-enhanced concentration polarization (CE-CP) mechanism. Others are unique for ODMPs, such as the effects of draw solution composition and membrane orientation, the internal concentration polarization (ICP) self-compensation effect, and the RSD-enhanced fouling. A general osmotic-resistance filtration model for ODMPs is presented in this paper to assist in the interpretation of the intrinsic interrelationships among those fouling factors and mechanisms. The impact and mechanisms of membrane fouling on contaminates removal are also reviewed briefly based on the limited existing literature on this topic. Finally, the available membrane fouling control strategies for ODMPs are summarized upon understanding the cause and effect of fouling. Based on the current review, future research prospects are proposed for further studying the membrane fouling in ODMPs.},

	abstract = {A fundamental study of microfiltration membrane fouling by emulsified oil was conducted using a combination of real-time visualization, force balance on a droplet, and permeate flux analysis. The model 0.1\% v/v hexadecane-in-water emulsions contained sodium dodecyl sulfate (0.1 mM, 0.4 mM, or 0.8 mM) to regulate interfacial tension. Direct Observation Through the Membrane tests with Anopore ( d pore =0.2 µm) and track-etch ( d pore =5 µm) membranes revealed three characteristic stages of membrane fouling: 1) droplet attachment and clustering, 2) droplet deformation, and 3) droplet coalescence. In qualitative agreement with visualization results, the force balance predicted that droplets ≲ 36 to 40 µm would remain pinned at d pore =5 µm pores while larger droplets would be swept off the surface by the crossflow drag. In a separate set of constant pressure crossflow filtration tests with track-etch membranes, the average oil rejection was≥98\% while the permeate flux decreased to a pseudo-steady-state {\textasciitilde}10\% of the initial value. The results indicate that membrane fouling by emulsified oil is controlled by droplet coalescence and crossflow shear: the transport of oil to the membrane surface by the permeate flow is balanced by the shear-induced removal of the droplets that coalesce to exceed a critical size.},

Here, nanocarbon architectures are designed by intercalating surface-functionalized, small-diameter, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) into reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets to create highly stable membranes with improved water permeability and enhanced membrane selectivity. With the intercalation of 10 nm diameter MWCNTs, the water permeability reaches 52.7 L m−2 h−1 bar−1, which is 4.8 times that of pristine rGO membrane and five to ten times higher than most commercial nanofiltration membranes. The membrane also attains almost 100\% rejection for three organic dyes of different charges. More importantly, the membrane can endure a turbulent hydrodynamic flow with cross-flow rates up to 2000 mL min−1 and a Reynolds number of 4667. Physicochemical characterization reveals that the inner graphitic walls of the MWCNTs can serve as spacers, while nanoscale rGO foliates on the outer walls interconnect with the assimilated rGO sheets to instill superior membrane stability. In contrast, intercalating with single-walled nanotubes fails to reproduce such stability. Overall, this nanoarchitectured design is highly versatile in creating both graphene-rich and CNT-rich all-carbon membranes with engineered nanochannels, and is regarded as a general approach in obtaining stable membranes for realizing practical applications of graphene-based membranes.},

Nevertheless, their scaling performance has been rarely reported. In the current study, the phenomenon of membrane integrity loss as a result of scaling is reported for the first time for osmotically driven membrane processes (ODMPs). The results show that the TFC membrane suffered marked flux reduction during the scaling in the active-layer-facing-feed-solution (AL-FS) orientation, accompanied with the severe damage of the membrane active layer. The membrane integrity loss is attributed to the scale formation and growth in the confined space between the membrane and the feed spacer. Compared with the CTA membrane, the TFC was more prone to scaling and membrane damage due to its unfavorable physiochemical properties (presence of Ca2 + binding sites and ridge-and-valley roughness). Although antiscalant addition was shown to be effective for scaling control in AL-FS, it was ineffective in the active-layer-facing-draw-solution orientation. The current study reveals the critical need for scaling control in ODMP processes with respect to the membrane integrity and flux stability. The results also have far-reaching implications for FO and PRO membrane design and process operation.},

In addition, the presence of DOM and electrolytes increased the release of dissolved Ag. The biological uptake of Ag species (determined as the total Ag in exposed cells) increased in the presence of DOM, but decreased in the presence of electrolytes. The presence of electrolytes did not result in any significant reduction in the bactericidal activity. Although an initial increase of the DOM to 2.5 mg-C L−1 attenuated the bactericidal efficacy of the immobilized AgNPs, an increase in the DOM concentration beyond 5 mg-C L−1 enhanced the bactericidal efficacy. This study found that the bactericidal activity of the immobilized AgNPs is less sensitive to the solution chemistry relative to the free AgNPs. This suggests that immobilizing the AgNPs in a supporting material is a good strategy to preserve their efficacy for disinfection in various aqueous matrices.},

In this paper, composite hollow fiber membranes with different levels of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) intrusion were prepared by coating a layer of PDMS on a Polyetherimide (PEI) hollow fiber substrate. Their applicability to EMBR for phenol removal was studied. The prepared membranes were characterized by microscopy and gas permeation test, and their performances were evaluated in aqueous–aqueous extractive membrane processes and EMBR process. The overall mass transfer coefficient for phenol, or k0, was found to be significantly affected by the level of PDMS intrusion in the composite membranes. This is because the penetration of PDMS into the porous substrate results in a denser membrane structure, which consequently increases the membrane resistance. A slight penetration of PDMS into the substrate was found to be necessary for the composite membranes to achieve high k0 while maintaining low inorganic flux across the membranes. Wilson-plot analysis suggests that membrane resistance dominated over liquid boundary layer resistances. After more than 250 h of EMBR operation, significant biofilm growth was observed on the composite membranes and the k0 was dropped but stabilized at around 7.5×10−7 m/s. This k0 was 7.5 times higher than commercial PDMS tubular membranes (without biofilm development) reported in previous studies, confirming the superiority of thin film composite membranes prepared in this work. It was also found that process optimization to control biofilm thickness is important in order to enhance phenol removal rate in EMBR.},

However, the fabrication of inorganic/organic thin-film composite membranes in hollow fiber configuration has rarely been reported due to the complexity of existing methods. A facile and economic method, in-situ vapor induced hydrolyzation process, was proposed for preparation of Al2O3/Polyethersulfone (PES) thin-film composite hollow fiber ultrafiltration (UF) membranes. The amphiphilic copolymer of PEO-PPO-PEO was introduced to bridge the Al2O3 nanoparticles and PES substrate, resulting in a more stable deposition of Al2O3 on the substrate. The surface morphology and pore size of Al2O3/PES membranes could be precisely tuned by controlling the addition of aluminum precursors. The resultant membrane presented a MWCO of 22 kDa and a high pure water permeability (PWP) of 280 L·m−2·h−1·bar−1 due to the completely coated surface hydrophilic Al2O3 ceramic layer. In addition, the as-prepared thin film composite membrane exhibited a lower membrane contact angle than most other mixed matrix inorganic/organic composite membranes. Due to the higher surface hydrophilicity, the composite membranes showed improved antifouling properties to humic acid (HA). This in-situ vapor induced hydrolyzation process was demonstrated to be promising for fabricating thin-film inorganic/organic composite hollow fiber membranes with high performance in separation processes.},

To mitigate membrane fouling, the outer surface of the inner-selective thin-film composite (TFC) polyetherimide (PEI) hollow fiber membrane was modified by depositing poly-(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) and poly acrylic acid (PAA) polyelectrolytes. The results show that the outer surface of the modified membrane had less pores exposed and was more negatively charged, which was beneficial for preventing the entrance and adsorption of the negatively charged foulants into the membrane substrate. It was further proved that the modified membrane was effective in reducing PRO fouling by organic macromolecules such as alginate and bovine serum albumin, while maintaining the mechanical properties and intrinsic separation properties well. Interestingly, after 200 ppm alginate was introduced to the feed water, the power density of the modified membrane could be maintained constant at 16.2 W·m− 2 at 15 bar while that of the non-modified membrane reduced around 17\% at the end of a 300-min testing period.

Electrospun nanofibrous membranes (ENMs) exhibit great potential to be applied in membrane processes due to their distinctive features such as high porosity of up to 90\% and large specific surface area.

This review summarizes the state-of-the-art progress on fabrication and modification of electrospun polymeric membranes with a particular emphasis on their advances, challenges and future improvement in water treatment applications. First, we briefly describe the complex process governing electrospinning, illustrate the effects of intrinsic properties of polymer solutions, operational parameters and surrounding environment conditions on the formation of nanofibers and resultant nanofibrous membranes, and summarize various designs of electrospinning apparatus. That is followed by reviewing the methods to prepare multifunctional composite ENMs, assorted into three categories, including modification in nanofibers, loading target molecules onto nanofibers surface, and implementing selective layers on the ENM surface. Comprehensive discussion about past achievements and current challenges regarding utilization of composite ENMs in water treatment are then provided.

	abstract = {As a low energy and chemical free process, gravity-driven membrane (GDM) filtration has shown a potential for seawater pretreatment in our previous studies. In this study, a pilot submerged GDM reactor (effective volume of 720 L) was operated over 250 days and the permeate flux stabilized at 18.6 ± 1.4 L/m2h at a hydrostatic pressure of 40 mbar. This flux was higher than those in the lab-scale GDM reactor (16.3 ± 0.2 L/m2h; effective volume of 8.4 L) and in the filtration cell system (2.7 ± 0.6 L/m2h; feed side volume of 0.0046 L) when the same flat sheet membrane was used. Interestingly, when the filtration cell was submerged into the GDM reactor, the flux (17.2 L/m2h) was comparable to the submerged membrane module. Analysis of cake layer morphology and foulant properties indicated that a thicker but more porous cake layer with less accumulation of organic substances (biopolymers and humics) contributed to the improved permeate flux. This phenomenon was possibly associated with longer residence time of organic substances and sufficient space for the growth, predation, and movement of the eukaryotes in the GDM reactor. In addition, the permeate flux of the submerged hollow fibre membrane increased with decreasing packing density. It is thought that the movement of large-sized eukaryotes could be limited when the space between hollow fibres was reduced. In terms of pretreatment, the GDM systems effectively removed turbidity, viable cells, and transparent exopolymer particles from the feed seawater. Importantly, extending the reactor operation time produced a permeate with less assimilable organic carbon and biopolymers. Thus, the superior quality of the GDM permeate has the potential to alleviate subsequent reverse osmosis membrane fouling for seawater treatment.},

Removal of the organics such as phenol by EMBR requires an effective membrane to selectively extract the organic compounds while rejecting water and other harsh inorganic components. In this work, novel composite membranes consisting of a highly porous substrate, made by tiered polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanofibers with ultrafine nanofibers on top (61 ± 12 nm in diameter), and a dense polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) selective layer have been fabricated. We have investigated (1) the effect of the pore size of PVDF nanofibrous substrates, (2) the effect of PDMS preparation method, and (3) the effect of prewetting agent on the resultant composite membranes’ morphologies, mechanical properties, and phenol removal performance. Compared with the symmetric substrate with a nanofiber diameter of 129 ± 13 nm, the tiered substrate can effectively support a uniform and defect-free PDMS coating. This is attributed to the smaller surface pore size of the tiered substrate as a result of its top ultrafine nanofibers. Besides, the use of partially precross-linked PDMS coating solution with increased viscosity and 50 wt \% glycerol aqueous solution as the prewetting agent to fill the substrate pores is preferred in order to mitigate PDMS intrusion. On the basis of the resistance model, the overall membrane resistance decreases with the decrease of the PDMS intrusion level, giving rise to a higher overall mass transfer coefficient, k0, for phenol removal. With the above-mentioned factors being taken into account, the first PDMS-coated PVDF nanofibrous composite membrane has been developed to remove phenol with a high k0 (over 4 times higher than the existing commercial PDMS tubular membrane) for EMBR. This study provides insights and guidelines for fabricating highly efficient membranes for organic removal in the EMBR process.},

Producing high quality whey products at low energy consumption entails novel techniques for whey concentration. This study proposes forward osmosis (FO) as a potential approach to concentrate whey protein solutions, which is superior to the concentration via reverse osmosis (RO), mainly owing to the low hydraulic pressure during FO process. In particular, this work validated the feasibility of FO-based whey concentration using high-performance hollow fiber membranes that were fabricated in-house. The investigation focused on the effects of various operating conditions on the concentration performance. The experimental results reveal that optimal concentration efficiency would be achieved by appropriately choosing the cross-flow velocity, draw solution concentration and the maximum attainable concentration of whey protein solution. Especially, the flux decline behaviour as a function of the whey protein concentration in the feed solution indicated rapid formation of a polarized or gel foulant layer at the membrane surface. The proposed mechanism was supported by the investigation of physical cleaning with water, showing that the post-process cleaning after the concentration cycle was able to recover the membrane performance, whereas the intermediate cleaning during one concentration cycle had little impact on the concentration efficiency enhancement. This study has practical significance for the application of FO in the concentration of dairy streams and other liquid foods.},

The results indicate that (i) the local critical flux (Jc,local) values increased with height along the membrane and with gas flow rate, but was relatively invariant with liquid flow rate; (ii) with respect to height, the mean bubble velocity and mean bubble area per bubble increased, while the number of bubbles per unit membrane area decreased; (iii) bubble momentum and mean area per bubble had the most positive correlation with Jc,local,; and (iv) the overall critical flux (Jc,overall, which is the average of the local critical fluxes) increased linearly with respect to the ratio of gas to total flow rates, and steeply then more gradually with respect to power required.

This was possibly due to the differences in available space for eukaryotic movement, hydraulic retention time (i.e., different organic loadings) or operation time (250days vs. 25–45days). Stichotrichia, Copepoda, and Pterygota were predominant eukaryotes at genus level in the pilot GDM. Furthermore, the GDM pretreatment led to a significantly lower RO fouling potential in comparison to the ultrafiltration (UF) system. This was attributed to the fact that GDM filtration produced a permeate with less amount of assimilable organic carbon (AOC) and biopolymers. Accordingly, lower amount of organic foulants (biopolymers and low molecular weight neutrals) and less biofilm formation on the GDM-RO membrane were observed. Although α-proteobacteria were dominant in both RO fouling layers, their bacterial community compositions at genus level were significantly different. Thalassobius had higher abundance in the GDM-RO fouling layers, while Erythrobacter and Hyphomonas were more predominant in the UF-RO fouling layers.},

	abstract = {Membrane distillation (MD) is an emerging green technology, but very few reports are available on its use for treating oily feeds, despite produced water representing a significant source of oily wastewater. Accordingly, this study was targeted at understanding the primary impediments of oily water MD by systematically investigating the influence of the key components (namely, oil-in-water emulsion, surfactant and salt) in such feeds. When the feed contained all three components typical in produced water, the MD performance severely deteriorated in terms of permeate flux and quality. Interestingly, for feeds containing oil or SDS or NaCl alone, the MD performance was reasonable, which indicates each component on its own did not impact the MD process significantly. Furthermore, the performance was also reasonable when the feed contained oil and NaCl, and improved when the feed contained oil and SDS. The adverse impact on the MD process was thereby traced to the combined presence of SDS and NaCl. Even in the absence of oil, increasing the concentrations of SDS and NaCl in the feed progressively deteriorated the permeate flux and quality. Therefore, to use MD for treating oily feeds necessitates a pre-treatment step to remove or significantly dilute either the surfactant or the salt. More understanding of the interaction between NaCl and SDS via molecular dynamics simulations would be useful to not only provide information on the interaction strength but also on means to circumvent such issues.},

Subsequently, fluorinated silica particles were synthesized and anchored on the substrates via a strong covalent bonding. Due to the high porosity as well as the high hydrophobicity, our membrane showed an outstanding performance for the recovery of CH4 in the membrane contactor, such that the CH4 flux reached 2900mg CH4/m2–h at the liquid velocity of 0.42m/s at which the liquid phase still controlled the overall mass transfer. The composite membrane prepared in this work also showed a much better performance in the CH4 recovery than a commercial polypropylene membrane made for degasification of water. In addition, a long-term test with tap water saturated with the model biogas made up of 60:40 CH4/CO2 mixture demonstrated that our membrane can be stably operated for more than 300h without experiencing pore wetting problem.},

	abstract = {A significant amount of methane (CH4) produced from anaerobic digestions of wastewater is dissolved in liquid effluent and discharged. The recovery of dissolved CH4 is therefore essential in ensuring an enhanced energy production of the anaerobic processes, and minimizing environmental impacts of the greenhouse gas. In this work, a membrane contactor is employed as a mass transfer equipment for the CH4 recovery. A mathematical model considering simultaneous desorption of CH4 and carbon dioxide (CO2) is developed using a resistance-in-series model to calculate the overall mass transfer coefficients. The simulations were validated with experimental results obtained using an in-house fabricated hollow fiber membrane as well as a real effluent from Anaerobic Membrane Bioreactor (AnMBR) and synthetic effluent made of water saturated with biogas. Results showed that the CO2 fluxes were higher than those of CH4 fluxes due to its higher concentration in liquid phase. A decrease of liquid phase mass transfer resistance by an increase in liquid velocity significantly enhanced both CH4 and CO2 fluxes. While, an increase in gas velocity slightly affected the CH4 flux but enhanced the CO2 flux considerably. It was also found that the CO2 desorption increased the CH4 recovery rate. The desorbed CO2 helped to increase the mass transfer driving force by reducing the partial pressure of CH4 in the gas side, and enhancing the gas phase mass transfer coefficient to facilitate CH4 desorption. The increase of liquid velocity increased mole fraction of CH4 in the gas outlet but decreased the rate of CH4 recovery. On the other hand, applying vacuum conditions to decrease gas pressure enhanced the rate of CH4 recovery but lower the CH4 mole fraction in the product gas.},

This study evaluated the performances of three different S-MD configurations; submerged direct contact membrane distillation (S-DCMD), submerged vacuum direct contact membrane distillation (S-VDCMD) and submerged vacuum membrane distillation (S-VMD) for SWRO brine treatment. A 13–77\% higher water flux was obtained by S-MDs with vacuum incorporation (S-VMD and S-VDCMD) compared to S-DCMD, attributed to higher driving force. Evaluation on the influence of feed concentration and permeate temperature revealed that S-MD with high vacuum was significantly affected by feed concentration. Meanwhile S-DCMD was more severely affected by feed temperature losses, based on the tendency of membrane pore crystallization formation. The crystallization tendency on the membrane surface was influenced by the presence of vacuum pressure. A repeated cycle of S-DCMD with membrane air-backwashing was effective for flux recovery and to reduce membrane crystallization, enabling to concentrate SWRO brine by 2.8 times of volume concentration factor.},

	abstract = {The performance of pressure retarded osmosis (PRO) processes is significantly limited by membrane fouling. This study systematically investigated PRO scaling by silica, which is one of the most common salts causing membrane scaling. In particular, the effect of silica concentration, the initial water flux, the chemistry of feed solution (FS) /draw solution (DS), and the type of membrane were studied in the PRO mode of operation. It has been observed that a low silica concentration (e.g., 10mg/L SiO2) could even cause membrane scaling during a PRO process. The rate and extent of the scaling was mainly governed by the internal concentration of silica in the membrane support layer and the solution chemistry of the FS/DS. The results suggested that the scaling could be mitigated by decreasing the internal concentration through the reduction of bulk silica concentration, the optimization of operating water flux, and the decrease in membrane structural parameter. The structural parameter seems to play a dominant role in PRO scaling by silica than the membrane materials and other physico-chemical properties. In addition, silica scaling can be controlled by lowering the pH of the FS and/or DS. For the first time, it has been demonstrated that utilizing an acidic DS was highly effective in controlling PRO scaling, which can be attributed to the low local pH in the membrane support layer as a result of the internal concentration polarization (ICP) of the reversely diffused H+. This method opens a new dimension for PRO scaling/fouling control.},

	abstract = {Inspired by mussels’ byssus with remarkable adhesive power that is neither degraded nor deformed in the marine environment, dopamine coating has emerged as an option for membrane surface modification. With its many advantages, direct-contact membrane distillation (DCMD) appears to hold potential for the recovery of high quality water from produced water. However, membrane fouling and pore wetting are challenging issues of long-term DCMD operations due to the presence of oils and surfactants in these waters. Hence, it is paramount to develop robust membranes with anti-fouling and anti-wetting properties for effective produced water treatment. In this study, we fabricated a composite hollow fiber membrane by single-step co-deposition of polydopamine (PDA)/polyethylenimine (PEI) onto the outer surface of a commercial hydrophobic polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) substrate. The successful co-deposition was verified using different characterization techniques. The composite membrane exhibited Janus wettability (Janus membranes have opposing properties at an interface) with its modified outer surface being in-air hydrophilic/underwater superoleophobic for preventing organics adhesion while insuring that unmodified pores beneath the surface remained hydrophobic for vapor transport. The anti-fouling and anti-wetting properties of the modified membrane were investigated via DCMD experiments by feeding a series of low surface tension solutions. In comparison to the pristine PVDF membrane, the modified membrane exhibited promising wetting resistant property against different surfactant types and excellent fouling resistant property against nonionic and cationic surfactants. Moreover, the modified membrane presented a promising long-term performance when feeding a cationic surfactant-stabilized petroleum-in-water emulsion mimicking produced water, during which a stable flux and excellent permeate quality were maintained throughout 7 days of operation. The efficacious combined effects of a hydration layer and protonated amine-functional groups on the PDA/PEI grafted layer could prevent membrane fouling and pore wetting. The results suggest that the mussel-inspired composite PVDF membrane could potentially be used for long-term water recovery from produced water via DCMD.},

In the quest for a more sustainable and efficient separation, solvent-resistant nanofiltration (SRNF) has emerged as a promising answer. This is because SRNF is a membrane-based process which offers the key advantages of high efficacy and low energy intensity separation. In particular, polymer-based membranes can offer compelling opportunities for SRNF with unprecedented cost-effectiveness. As a result, intensive research efforts have been devoted into developing novel polymer-based membranes with solvent-resistant capacities as well as exploring potential applications in different types of industries. In this review, we aim to give an overview of the recent progress in the development of the state-of-the-art polymer-based membranes for SRNF in the first section. Emerging nanomaterials for mixed matrix and thin film nanocomposite membranes are also covered in this section. This is followed by a discussion on the current status of membrane engineering and SRNF membrane commercialization. In the third section, we highlight recent efforts in adopting SRNF for relevant industrial applications such as food, bio-refinery, petrochemical, fine chemical and pharmaceutical industries followed by separations of enantiomers in stereochemistry, homogeneous catalysis and ionic liquids.

	abstract = {Pressure-retarded osmosis (PRO) has attracted worldwide attention for its potential applications in renewable osmotic energy harvesting, low energy seawater desalination, and industrial waste brine disposal. However, membrane fouling is one of the major issues limiting PRO performance with the use of a high-salinity draw solution and a low-value impaired feedwater. This study systematically investigated membrane fouling in the PRO process using a real wastewater retentate (a waste byproduct from wastewater reclamation plants) as the PRO feed. Organic fouling (e.g., by humic substances) and inorganic fouling (e.g., by calcium phosphate) were identified to be the major types of fouling, where the latter dominated the overall water-flux decline. The internal PRO membrane fouling was exacerbated by internal concentration polarization (ICP) and intermolecular interactions between the organic macromolecules and the scaling precursor ions (e.g., Ca2+). A limiting flux that was independent of the initial flux (i.e., applied pressure) was observed during the PRO fouling and was explained by a novel PRO limiting flux model. A membrane with a smaller structural parameter could achieve a higher limiting flux in PRO. A simple and effective pressure-assisted osmotic backwashing protocol was developed to clean the internally fouled membrane that could restore over 92\% of the water flux within a short cleaning period (15mins). The PRO performance could also be significantly improved by decreasing the feedwater pH that mitigated alkaline scaling. Finally, performing the PRO membrane fouling test in the active-layer-facing-feed-solution (AL-FS) orientation revealed that the integral cellulose triacetate (CTA) membrane exhibited strong mechanical stability and anti-fouling tendency whereas the thin-film composite (TFC) membrane was not mechanically stable in this orientation. This study for the first time identified that an integral membrane instead of a TFC membrane is an excellent candidate for PRO operation in the AL-FS mode for fouling control.},

Membrane fouling is one of the main challenges, especially when real wastewater is used as feed solution in the PRO system. Low pressure nanofiltration (NF) pretreatment was thus adopted in current study to pretreat the wastewater reverse osmosis (RO) brine collected from a wastewater treatment plant prior to feeding to the PRO process. Three NF membranes were compared in terms of the membrane properties, NF permeate (i.e., PRO feed) quality and the PRO membrane performance. Results showed that the PRO water flux could increase to 30.5L/m2/h (LMH) at 16bar applied pressure by adopting the pretreated solution using an in-house made low-pressure NF hollow fiber membrane module, in contrast to the water flux of 9 LMH for untreated wastewater RO brine. A systematic analysis of water chemistry and membrane characterization (electron dispersed X-ray (EDX) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) depth profiling) revealed that calcium salts, organic compounds, and silica could be the main contributors to the membrane fouling in PRO. Low-pressure NF was able to mitigate the fouling potential from multivalent ions and organic matters, but silica scaling in PRO needs to be further addressed.},

The surface of the composite membrane was modified to exhibit high surface free energy. The membrane is in-air superamphiphilic, underwater superoleophobic and under-oil superhydrophobic. It can treat various types of oil/water mixtures, from simple layered solutions to emulsions (including surfactant-free or surfactant-stabilized oil-in-water and water-in-oil emulsions) without external driving force or under an ultralow pressure (0.1bar) in a cross-flow filtration process. It shows a flux up to 2000L/m2h and high separation efficiency ({\textgreater} 99.99\% in terms of water and oil purities in the permeation) in the cross-flow filtration process. The membrane also exhibits an excellent robustness under harsh conditions, including strong acidic or alkaline solutions, hot water and petroleum. In addition, it presents remarkable antifouling and easy-cleaning properties, which were demonstrated in a 50-h continuous operation.},

To improve the self-assembly of polymersomes with simultaneous MP reconstitution, the study reported herein aimed to understand the effects of different variants of the rehydration procedure on the MP reconstitution into BCP membranes. The model MP used in this study was AquaporinZ (AqpZ), an α-helical MP that has been shown to have a high permeation rate exclusive to water molecules. Comparing four rehydration methods differing in the hydration time (i.e., brief wetting or full hydration) and medium (i.e., in buffer or AqpZ stock solution), prehydration with buffer prior to adding AqpZ was found to be most desirable and reproducible reconstitution method because it gave rise to the highest proportion of well-formed vesicles with intact AqpZ functionality as evidenced by the transmission electron microscopy images, dynamic light scattering, and stopped-flow analyses. The mechanisms by which effective AqpZ reconstitution takes place were also investigated and discussed. Small-angle X-ray scattering analysis shows that hydrating the initially dry multilamellar BCP films allows the separation of lamellae. This is anticipated to increase the membrane fluidity that facilitates a fast and spontaneous integration of AqpZ as the detergent concentration is considerably lowered below its critical micelle concentration. Dilution of detergent can result in precipitation of proteins in the absence of well-fluidized membranes for protein integration that underscores the importance of membrane fluidity in MP reconstitution.},

It can transport through the silicon-based rubber polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) via the solution-diffusion mechanism. To improve the phenol removal efficiency in extractive processes, dense PDMS membranes with different macromolecular structures have been developed and evaluated in this work. The condensation-cured PDMS membranes (PA) with network architecture exhibited higher phenol partition coefficients (K) than the hydrosilylation-cured PDMS membranes with linear and branch architectures. This was attributed to the four-armed quaternary-siloxy linkages formed in the three-dimensional network structure, increasing the free volume for phenol passage and hydrogen bonding between phenol and PDMS matrix. The K of PA was further enhanced by optimizing the PDMS precursor chain length and cross-linker amount, and the corresponding membrane mechanical properties and phenol overall mass transfer coefficients (k0) were examined. The optimal PA formulation was utilized to fabricate a highly effective nanofibrous composite membrane via spray coating. The resultant composite membrane exhibited a k0 of 18.3 ± 1.3 × 10−7m/s in an aqueous-aqueous extractive process, significantly outperforming the commercial counterpart with 45\% increment. This is the first demonstration of the importance of PDMS macromolecular structures on phenol extraction.

	abstract = {In microfiltration and ultrafiltration, particulate foulants are inevitably deposited on the membrane surface, forming a cake whose structure and behaviour play crucial roles in the subsequent filterability of the suspensions. This study investigated the impact of fouling by three types of latex particulate foulants, which were of the same size (3µm) but with different surface charges. Surprisingly, although the positively charged aminated latex was expected to perform the worst in the flux-decline experiments due to attractive electrostatic interaction with the negatively charged membrane, this latex displayed the best performance relative to the two negatively charged latex. To understand these counter-intuitive results, a novel network model (Han et al., 2017) [1] and three-dimensional (3D) optical coherence tomography (OCT) image analysis (Li et al., 2016) [2] were employed to reveal the underlying reasons for the different fouling behaviors. Two mechanisms were found to contribute to the worse performance of the negatively charged latex. Firstly, these particles tended to deposit on the pore rather than non-pore region of the membrane due to the repulsive particle-membrane electrostatic interactions, which led to a more complete pore blockage and thereby greater initial cake resistance. Secondly, these particles had a greater tendency to cluster and deposit on other deposited latex due to similarly repulsive particle-membrane and particle-particle interactions, which led to a more inhomogeneous cake and thereby greater specific cake resistance.},

However, the lack of suitable membrane modules and the issue caused by the membrane fouling greatly impede the practical application of PRO to a larger scale. In this study, two-inch thin film composite hollow fiber modules were fabricated by using in-house developed PRO membranes. The produced PRO modules have a maximum effective area of 0.5m2. By assessing the PRO performances of the modules with different sizes, external concentration polarization (ECP) was found to have significant impact on the flux reduction during module scale-up. Different module designs, including fiber bundles, distribution baffles and distribution tubes, were thus adopted as an attempt to boost the membrane performance. A power density of 8.9W/m2 at 15bar was obtained using tap water as feed and 1M NaCl solution as draw solution. PRO performance tests were also carried out using the developed two-inch modules on a pilot-scale setup with actual wastewater retentate as feed solution. Low pressure nanofiltration was selected as the pretreatment of the wastewater retentate to mitigate fouling. A power density of larger than 8W/m2 was obtained when pretreated wastewater retentate was used as the feed solution, implying high potential of PRO in the pilot scale. Nevertheless, full potential of PRO can only be realized by mitigating ECP, which could be achieved by improving the module design in the further endeavor.},

This paper describes the hydrophobic modification of the chemical surface of a polyvinylidene fluoride hollow-fiber membrane using a commercial perfluoropolyether, Fluorolink S10. The contact angle of the modified membrane was influenced by the modification parameters, and hence parameter optimization was required to obtain a highly hydrophobic membrane. The sodium hydroxide concentration (pH 8, 10 and 12), dehydrofluorination time (30, 60 and 90min), and chemical solution grafting time (30, 60 and 90min) were identified as the control parameters of this modification and were optimized using the Taguchi approach. The optimized membrane was then applied to recover methane from anaerobic membrane bioreactor effluent and benchmarked with a commercial polypropylene membrane manufactured for degasification of water. The contact angle of the polyvinylidene fluoride membrane was improved by 32\% after the surface modification (under the optimal modification condition indicated by the Taguchi method). The membrane mass transfer coefficient was measured as 1.53 × 10−4m/s. Our membrane showed better methane recovery performance than the commercial polypropylene membrane and a very stable flux without pore wetting during 10 days of operation with synthetic effluent (made by saturating a 60:40 methane/carbon dioxide mixture into tap water). In addition, the membrane prepared in this study could be operated without significant fouling (7\% flux drop during 8 days of operation) with real anaerobic membrane bioreactor effluent.},

However, membranes used in GLMC are prone to pore wetting due to insufficient hydrophobicity and low chemical resistance, resulting in significant increase in mass transfer resistance. To mitigate this issue, inorganic-organic fluorinated titania/polyvinylidene fluoride (fTiO2/PVDF) composite hollow fiber (HF) membranes was prepared via facile in-situ vapor induced hydrolyzation method, followed by hydrophobic modification. The proposed composite membranes were expected to couple the superb chemical stability of inorganic and high permeability/low cost of organic materials. The continuous fTiO2 layer deposited on top of PVDF substrate was found to possess a tighter microstructure and better hydrophobicity, which effectively prevented the membrane from wetting and lead to a high CO2 absorption flux (12.7 × 10−3 mol m−2 s−1). In a stability test with 21-day operation of GLMC using 1M monoethanolamine (MEA) as the absorbent, the fTiO2/PVDF membrane remained to be intact with a CO2 absorption flux decline of ∼16\%, while the pristine PVDF membrane suffered from a flux decline of ∼80\% due to membrane damage. Overall, this work provides an insight into the preparation of high-quality inorganic/organic composite HF membranes for CO2 capture in GLMC application.},

The suitability for on-line monitoring is discussed. The available methods to determine fouling propensity of the RO feedwater are based on fouling by particulates, scalants, organics and biofilms. For particulate fouling a range of indices have been developed based on the filterability of the feed; indices for scaling potential rely on inorganic species analysis. For organic and biofouling potential there are a range of analyses of total and specific organic components. While most of the fouling potential methods involve off-line characterization, some are amenable to on-line detection. To monitor the state of an RO process, sensors can be directly installed on a spiral wound module (in-situ) or on a side stream (ex-situ) ‘canary’ cell that simulates the plant operation. The available techniques, critically reviewed in this paper, can be incorporated into the RO process to provide information on the nature of the foulants deposited on the membrane. These techniques provide on-line observation, some of which are suitable for large scale plants and others are more suited for basic research.},

Both MBRs adopted the same external hollow fiber membrane configurations and operating conditions. The collected permeates of the MBRs were subsequently fed to the respective RO systems. The results showed that the NF-MBR (operated at a constant flux of 10 L/m2h) achieved superior MBR permeate quality due to enhanced biodegradation and high rejection capacity of the NF membrane, leading to lower RO fouling rates (∼3.3 times) as compared to the UF-MBR. Further analysis indicated that the cake layer fouling that caused the cake-enhanced osmotic pressure (CEOP) effect contributed predominantly to the transmembrane pressure (TMP) increase in the NF-MBR, while irreversible pore fouling was the major reason for UF membrane fouling. Furthermore, it was found that the biopolymers (i.e., organics with MW {\textgreater} 10 kDa) were the main components present in the foulants of the NF/UF membranes and RO membranes. The analysis indicated that the NF-MBR + RO system at recovery of 90\% has comparable energy consumption as the UF-MBR + RO system at recovery of 75\%. Our findings proved the feasibility of the NF-MBR + RO for water reclamation at a high recovery rate.},

This work focused on a fundamental issue of spacer design, i.e., investigating the effects of spacer orientations on the fouling behavior during a membrane process. A series of fouling experiments with different spacer orientation were carried out to in situ characterize the formation of a cake layer in a spacer unit cell via 3D optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging. The cake layers formed at different times were digitalized for quantitatively analyzing the variation in the cake morphology as a function of time. In particular, the local deposition rates were evaluated to determine the active regions where the instantaneous changes in deposit thickness were significant. The characterization results indicate that varying the spacer orientation could substantially change the evolution of membrane fouling by particulate foulants and thereby result in a cake layer with various morphologies; the competition between growth and erosion at different locations would instantaneously respond to the micro-hydrodynamic environment that might change with time. This work confirms that the OCT-based characterization method is a powerful tool for exploring novel spacer design.},

	abstract = {Pressure retarded osmosis (PRO) is an innovative technique to yield osmotic energy. Nevertheless, the PRO performance is exacerbated by the severe membrane fouling occurring within the porous support. It is a potential alternative for sustainable power harvesting to change the membrane orientation from active layer facing draw solution (AL−DS) or PRO mode to active layer facing feed solution (AL−FS) or FO mode for a low-fouling propensity. A novel integral PRO hollow fiber membrane was developed in this work by phase inversion and followed with a facile cross-linking post-treatment. The structure and properties of the resultant membrane were systematically investigated using a series of characterization protocols. The PRO performance of the membrane was studied under various hydraulic pressures at the AL−FS orientation. The results reveal that the substrate with sponge-like structure and relatively dense inner surface can better withstand high pressure in PRO process. Two steps of cross-linking endowed the membrane with a smaller pore size on the outer surface that exhibits high rejection against various inorganic salts. The novel integral membrane can achieve a stable power density output around 4.3Wm−2 at 12 {\textasciitilde} 13bar hydraulic pressure, using a real wastewater reverse osmosis (RO) retentate and 1.0M sodium chloride as the feed and draw stream, correspondingly. This result demonstrates that the PRO operation in the AL−FS orientation (FO mode) offers a significant advantage over the AL−DS orientation (PRO mode) by eliminating the pretreatment of the feed water or/and other measures associated with membrane fouling control in the PRO mode. To implement the PRO operation with the AL−FS orientation, developing a robust membrane with an integral structure is critical. The newly developed integral hollow fiber membrane via chemical cross-linking presents the potential for PRO operation in the AL−FS orientation.},

However, the impact of NO-mediated biofilm dispersal on the taxa composition of natural communities as well as the potential selection for non-responding community members have rarely been addressed. Here, we investigated the effect of diethylenetriamine (DETA) NONOate, an NO donor with a long half-life, on biofilm dispersal of a bacterial community responsible for membrane biofouling to address this question. The biofilm of a complex community from a fouled industrial reverse osmosis (RO) membrane was dispersed over 50\% by 500μM of DETA NONOate treatment in a continuous flow system. Once-daily treatment with DETA NONOate in a laboratory-scale RO system demonstrated its anti-biofouling effect by delaying the transmembrane pressure increase during constant-flux filtration. Characterization of the bacterial communities of dispersed cells and remaining biofilm cells using a 16S Illumina MiSeq metabarcoding approach demonstrated that biofilm dispersal by DETA NONOate had no selection bias in the community.},

Past studies have affirmed a relationship between the fluidized GAC media and fouling trends, and also shed light on the effects of superficial liquid velocity, power requirement, GAC particle diameter and foulant type on the effectiveness of fouling mitigation during microfiltration. In particular, the ratios of the local critical flux to the overall critical flux (Jc,local/Jc,overall) were shown to deviate from unity, owing to different expanded bed heights of the fluidized GAC and causes non-uniform fouling across the membrane. Accordingly, this study was aimed at understanding the impact of different overall GAC concentrations, which give different expanded bed heights, on the extent of fouling mitigation. Monodisperse millimeter-sized GAC were used as the fluidized media and the particulate foulants were micrometer-sized polystyrene and bentonite particles. The results indicate that the highest overall concentration was advantageous in terms of enabling (i) higher membrane fouling mitigation at a lower power required per unit permeate (Pp) for the polystyrene foulant but not bentonite foulant; and (ii) more similar Jc,local values over the three heights investigated, which implies more uniform fouling mitigation across the membrane. The relative benefits of adjusting overall GAC concentration versus the particle diameter of the GAC media were also critically assessed.},

	abstract = {Extractive membrane bioreactors (EMBRs) are promising wastewater treatment processes combining an aqueous-aqueous extractive membrane process and biodegradation. The target contaminants diffuse through an extractive membrane and are metabolized by the active biofilm attached on the downstream membrane surface and microorganisms in the bioreactor. The benefit of EMBRs is that the biomass is not exposed to the potentially hostile feed conditions (high salinity, pH extremes etc.). The physicochemical properties of membrane surfaces on the receiving side facing the bioreactor are critical in controlling the extent and nature of the membrane-attached biofilm. In this work, novel nanofibrous composite membranes with a superhydrophobic surface (coded as NC) or a superhydrophilic surface (coded as M-NC) on the receiving side have been designed, developed and evaluated in EMBRs. Compared to commercial polydimethysiloxane (PDMS) tubular membranes, both NC and M-NC possessed 10 times higher phenol extraction efficiency in an aqueous-aqueous extractive membrane process. The uncontrolled biofilm growth on the membrane surface after 12 days of cross flow EMBR (CF-EMBR) operation resulted in 62\% reductions of overall mass transfer coefficients (k0) of both NC and M-NC. However, both membranes exhibited better performance in a submerged EMBR (S-EMBR) configuration due to the presence of air bubbles scouring on the membrane surface. Moreover, the fouling-releasing fluoro-polymeric surface of the hydrophobic NC was able to attenuate the tendency of microbial attachment and encourage biofilm scouring from the membrane surface in the S-EMBR. In contrast, more polysaccharides were present in the biofilm on the poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG)-modified M-NC surface, which acted as adhesives to tightly immobilize the biofilm on the membrane surface. Lastly, the NC which exhibited a higher stable k0 of 5.7 × 10−7 m/s in 12 days of S-EMBR operation, has been tested in a pilot S-EMBR to treat actual industrial wastewater. It showed a stable and competitive k0 of 6.5 × 10−7 m/s in 31 days operation, demonstrating its feasibility for hostile industrial wastewater treatment.},

Reports on both the lab-scale and pilot-scale have emanated, but the hydrodynamics of the fluidized GAC, which is unsurprisingly found to be closely tied to the extent of fouling mitigation, has only been studied on the lab-scale. The current study therefore was aimed at evaluating the feasibility of using a non-invasive accelerometer for a practical pilot-scale AnFMBR, in order to provide a means for real-time monitoring of such processes. A lab-scale AnFMBR was first investigated, and the efficacy of the accelerometer to differentiate between various positions along the reactor (i.e., different heights and sides) and operating conditions (i.e., superficial liquid velocity and overall GAC concentration) was proven. Then, the same effects on an idealized pilot-scale AnFMBR with new membranes and DI water was assessed, which also indicates that the accelerometer signals were able to reveal the hydrodynamics of the fluidized GAC in the reactor. Finally, in a practical pilot-scale AnFMBR with wastewater the accelerometer was shown to be able to diagnose the de-fluidization of the GAC, due to severe clogging issues, which thereby eliminated the fouling mitigation capacity. Trends in the trans-membrane pressure (TMP) and flux data were deficient in indicating the de-fluidization of the GAC.},

The resultant fTiO2-SiO2/PVDF composite hollow fiber membrane exhibited a tighter pore size of {\textasciitilde}25nm and a desired water contact angle of {\textasciitilde}124°, which effectively prevented membrane wetting. The CO2 absorption fluxes of 8.0 and 5.6 × 10-3mol·m-2·s-1 were achieved due to the lower mass transfer resistance, by using 1M of monoethanolamine (MEA) and sodium taurinate as absorbents with a liquid velocity of 0.25m·s-1, respectively. The long-term stability test showed a good integrity between the fTiO2-SiO2 layer and the PVDF substrate after 31-days of GLMC operation. The main benefit is the robust fluorinated inorganic layer which exhibited strong chemical resistance and high hydrophobicity, thus preventing membrane damage and pore wetting. Overall, this work provides an insight into the preparation of high-performance inorganic/organic composite hollow fiber membranes for carbon dioxide (CO2) removal in GLMC application.},

	abstract = {In this study, a novel CoFe2O4 nanocatalyst impregnated Al2O3 ceramic membrane was prepared via a urea-assisted one-step combustion method. The catalytic membrane was characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) with energy dispersive X-Ray analysis (EDX) and applied for the catalytic degradation of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) via peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation under a dead-end membrane filtration mode for the first time. Results indicate that CoFe2O4 could be impregnated into the macropores throughout the whole Al2O3 ceramic membrane via this method and the CoFe2O4 loading amount could be controlled by the multiple impregnation cycles. The membrane filtration operation mode significantly enhances the accessibility of the catalytic active sites to PMS and SMX in microreactor environment and thus the CoFe2O4 impregnated membrane displays excellent catalytic activity for the SMX degradation. The pure water permeability flux can maintain at ∼3000 L m−2 h−1 bar−1 (LMHB) with the catalyst loading amount of 0.015 g/g Al2O3. In the membrane filtration system, the removal rate of SMX with the initial concentration of 10 mg L−1 can achieve to ∼98\%, 70\% and 40\% with the residence time of 90, 36 and 18 s. The catalytic membrane shows a great tolerance at wide pH range (3–11), the existence of humic acid and anions. Meanwhile, the membrane shows self-cleaning property by retaining {\textgreater}90\% of initial flux after 3 treatment cycles. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and radical quenching experiments indicate that both sulfate radical and hydroxyl radical are generated and sulfate radical is the dominant active species in the process.},

	abstract = {Polymersomes-based reverse osmosis (RO) membrane (PBM) for desalination was reported for the first time. An amphiphilic tri-block copolymer, PMOXA6-PDMS35-PMOXA6 (ABA), was self-assembled to form polymersomes with spherical nanostructure. The polymersomes were then immobilized into a polyamide network via an interfacial polymerization reaction on top of polysulfone membrane substrate. Under a moderate salinity condition, the PBM presented almost doubled water permeability and higher salt rejection than the control membrane without polymersomes in the polyamide network. Based on the results of a series of characterization the better water permeation of the PBM is believed to result from larger globular features containing highly water permeable polymersomes, which created a higher void fraction in the selective layer, whereas the highly cross-linked polyamide selective layer as well as the polymersome bilayer’s impermeability to NaCl may led to the enhanced salt rejection. Surprisingly, at an elevated NaCl concentration up to 32,000 ppm, the PBM exhibited {\textasciitilde} 60\% water flux enhancement and even better NaCl rejection as compared with commercial seawater RO membranes. In general, the PBM presented a water flux similar to the RO membranes with loose polyamide matrix (BW30), but a rejection behavior close to the dense RO membranes (SW30). This study provides a paradigm shift in developing new-generation RO membranes for energy and cost-effective desalination process.},

	abstract = {A dynamic membrane (DM) is a layer of particles deposited via permeation drag onto a conventional membrane, such that the deposited particles act as a secondary membrane that minimizes fouling of the primary membrane to lower transmembrane pressures (TMP) and enable higher permeate fluxes. Since the first DM was created in 1966 at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, numerous studies have reported synthesis of DMs using various materials and explored their abilities to perform reverse osmosis (RO), nanofiltration (NF), ultrafiltration (UF) and microfiltration (MF). DMs are classified into two categories, namely, (i) self-formed, whereby the feed constituents form the DM; and (ii) pre-deposited, whereby the DM is formed by a layer of particles other than the feed prior to introduction of the feed. This paper endeavors to present a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art on the latter. Key materials used as DMs, their formation and various factors influencing it, regeneration of DMs and modifications to DM systems for performance enhancement are discussed. The role of DMs in preventing fouling in the primary membrane (PM) is explained. The applications of DMs in four major areas, namely, salt and organic solute rejection, treatment of industrial effluents, treatment of water and wastewater, and oily-wastewater treatment are reviewed. Furthermore, technical and economic advantages of DMs over conventional processes are considered, and challenges in current DM research are discussed. Finally, directions for future research are suggested.},

The analysis of gas storage performance reveals that the generation of new porosity resulted in enhanced CO2 and H2 adsorption. In particular, the NiDOBDC/GO composite with 10 wt\% GO loading exhibited the highest CO2 and H2 storage values, up to 10.5 mmol/g (298 K, 20 bar) and 1.39 mmol/g (298 K, 20 bar), respectively, values that are significantly higher than those of the Ni-DOBDC metal–organic framework. Besides, enhanced CO2/N2 selectivity was also observed for NiDOBDC/GO composite due to the additional storage sites for CO2. The strategy demonstrated in this work can also be applied to other microporous materials to enhance their gas adsorption properties.},

In this work, we prepared a highly porous microstructured (HPμS) support membrane with a suitable mechanical strength to enhance the water permeability of an RO membrane. The HPμS support membrane was prepared by increasing the thermodynamic instability of a 10 wt\% polymer solution and thereby facilitating rapid desolvation. The rapid desolvation formed the narrow and regularly arranged pore structure in the sublayer, and we proposed the mechanism for the sublayer structure formation based on analyses of the thermodynamic properties of such a binary system. Owing to the narrow and regular structure, the HPμS support membranes showed the exceptional mechanical strength, which was comparable to the strength of support membranes used for conventional RO membranes. Also, the HPμS support membranes successfully endowed an in-house RO membrane with the performance (water permeability of 4.68 L m−2 h−1 bar−1 and NaCl rejection of 98.3\%) surpassing commercial RO membranes and thin-film nanocomposite membranes recently reported in the literature.},

	abstract = {This work presents an energy analysis and optimization of the hollow fiber membrane contactors for the recovery of dissolved methane (CH4) in effluents of anaerobic membrane bioreactor wastewater treatment processes. The obtained CH4 could be merged with biogas for further purification or used with a micro-turbine for electricity generation to achieve an energy self-sufficient wastewater treatment process. A mathematical model considering simultaneous CH4 and carbon dioxide (CO2) desorption was used to estimate the membrane area required to remove the dissolved CH4, as well as quality of the outlet gas from the membrane contactor. Energy balance between electrical energy obtained from the recovered CH4 and energies consumed by vacuum and liquid pumps for the operation of membrane contactor were investigated and reported as a Net Electricity obtained per m3 of effluent or simply Net E. Results revealed that a combination of a high strip gas flow rate and slightly low vacuum condition closed to the atmospheric pressure can provide the highest Net E at 0.178 MJ/m3. This value is 85.37\% of the total electrical energy that can generated from a 90\% recovery of dissolved CH4 using an effluent saturated with a 60\%vol CH4 biogas and flow rate at 2 m3/day. The calculation was made based on the assumptions that 1) the membrane contactor is operated in a non-wetting mode where membrane properties remain constant, 2) flux decline due to the membrane fouling is not considered and 3) the energy required for membrane cleaning and other relevant activities are not factored into the energy analysis. Based on our results, to obtain a high CH4 mole fraction at the gas outlet, a low strip gas flow rate is recommended, however, the operating gas pressure needs to be lowered by applying a vacuum condition to improve the Net E. In addition, it was found that the Net E could be improved by increasing the number of membrane fibers, and lowering the liquid flow rate. The CH4 recovery efficiency could also be optimized to obtain an optimal Net E.},

In this work, we present an approach through which transport modeling is employed in fabricating specialized nanofiltration membranes, that experimentally demonstrate enhanced selectivity. Specifically, the Donnan-Steric Pore Model with dielectric exclusion (DSPM-DE) is used to probe for membrane properties desirable in desalination pretreatment. Nanofiltration membranes are systematically fabricated in-house using layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition to validate model predictions and to develop a new specialized membrane for this application. The new membrane presents a 30\% increase in permeability and a 50\% reduction in permeate hardness relative to state-of-the-art NF membranes. Our results indicate that a ‘specialized’ tight membrane can outperform looser counterparts in both permeability and selectivity. Given the possibility of extending this framework to other applications, the work furthers our understanding of the relationships governing membrane form and function, while having broad potential implications for future nanofiltration membranes used in chemical separation and purification.},

	abstract = {The energy-efficient reverse osmosis (EERO) desalination process was recently developed for cost-effective high total water recovery. It feeds the retentate from one or more single-stage reverse osmosis (SSRO) stages in series to a countercurrent membrane cascade with recycle (CMCR) consisting of a terminal reverse osmosis (RO) stage and one or more low salt-rejection stages. The CMCR permits retentate refluxing in the low salt-rejection stages and multi-pass processing of permeate. The novel 2-2 EERO process is advanced that involves two SSRO stages in series with a 2-stage CMCR. To address problems encountered in a pilot-scale test of the EERO process, it develops an operating strategy involving boosting the pressure to the low salt-rejection stage of the CMCR to compensate for using membranes with a higher salt rejection than required. A process embodiment for mitigating concentration polarization is also advanced. The first estimate of the total cost of water production for three EERO process configurations is made. The EERO process can reduce the osmotic pressure differential by 50\% relative to conventional SSRO for the same total water recovery and can achieve 75\% total water recovery at a lower total cost of water production than conventional SSRO operated at just 50\% water recovery.},

The as-obtained materials were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, ultraviolet–visible diffuse reflection spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy and photocurrent-time measurement. Results indicate a strong electric coupling interaction between SCN and CdS due to the heterojunction formed at the amine functionalities sites and oxidized chain terminations of SCN. Two typical pollutants like rhodamine B (RhB) and colorless bisphenol A (BPA) were used for the evaluation of photocatalytic activity. The best-performing CdS/SCN composite (i.e., CS5) synthesized exhibited enhanced visible-light-driven photocatalytic RhB efficiency of about 8.71 and 4.06 times higher than those of pure exfoliated SCN and CdS, respectively. As for BPA degradation, the CS5 composite was 9.00 and 3.61 times more efficient than that of exfoliated SCN and CdS, respectively. These excellent performances were found to be attributable to the remarkable charge carrier separation between CdS and exfoliated SCN with the aid of heterojunction interfacial structures. More importantly, the exfoliated SCN substantially reinforced the photostability of the CdS nanoparticles. Evaluation of the photocatalytic H2 evolution showed that the visible-light H2 production rate of the best-performing CS5 composite was also much greater than the constituents at 247.72 μmol h−1 g−1. Cyclic tests demonstrated the stability of the CS5 composite over repeated use. A possible mechanism was proposed to explain the photocatalytic reaction process. This study provides new insights into the preparation of highly efficient and stable sulfide-based composite photocatalysts, which are promising for implementation in wide-ranging environmental applications.},

Accordingly, the evolution with time, the frequency distribution and the space-time profiles of the axial dispersion coefficients are evaluated. The results demonstrate that (i) the fast radial segregation gives rise to the sharp increase and decrease of the axial dispersion coefficients of respectively the large and small particles in both the active and passive regions; (ii) the axial dispersion coefficients in the active region is an order-of-magnitude higher than that in the passive region; (iii) after the radial segregation, the frequency distributions of the axial dispersion coefficients of the large particles, the small particles and all the particles are normal distributions; (iv) the greatest axial dispersion coefficients of both particle types are at the upper part of the active region near the bed surface; (v) increasing the rotating speed and particle diameter ratio clearly enhances the axial dispersion intenstity in the active and passive regions; and (vi) axial segregation results in the greatest axial dispersion near the end walls, while most of the rest of the drum exhibit equally low axial dispersion. The results obtained here contribute towards understanding the dynamical response of the axial dispersion of different particle types to the inevitable radial and axial segregation phenomena, and are expected to be valuable for improving operations and advancing theoretical models of such granular systems with constituents of different sizes.},

	abstract = {The fluidization of millimeter-sized media to mitigate the membrane fouling by micron-sized particles has received increasing attention, but a question that remained unanswered is the effect of the sphericity of the fluidized media on the energy-efficiency of fouling mitigation, which motivated the current study. Four millimeter-sized fluidized media types, of which three had similar equivalent volume diameters, were investigated, with micron-sized polystyrene particles serving as the particulate foulant. The direct observation through the membrane (DOTM) technique was used to determine the local critical flux, while a high-speed video camera was used to capture the local fluidization hydrodynamics (namely, particle velocity, particle rotation velocity, particle contact area and particle momentum). The results indicate that (i) although smaller media mitigated fouling better among higher-sphericity media, the smallest, low-sphericity media here performed similarly or worse; (ii) lower-sphericity media gave lower particle rotation, greater contact area with the membrane, and lower particle momentum; (iii) in contrast to higher-sphericity media, the extent of local fouling mitigation decreased as the particle velocities increased and the local critical flux was not the most strongly correlated with particle momentum; (iv) lower-sphericity media generally gave lower overall critical flux for the same hydrodynamic characteristic; (v) particle sphericity is a negligible factor in the energy-efficiency of fouling mitigation by similar-sized fluidized media, but, between low-sphericity media, the larger media was more energy-efficient. The findings here highlight the non-negligible influence of the particle sphericity of the fluidized media, and are expected to be valuable in the optimization of the properties of the fluidized media towards more energy-efficient membrane fouling mitigation.},

	abstract = {The development of novel hybrid photocatalysts with high efficiency and durability for photocatalytic degradation and hydrogen production is highly desired, but still remains a great challenge currently. In this work, novel hierarchical composites consisting of petal-like Zn3In2S6 nanosheets and varying amounts of fluorine doped polymeric carbon nitride (FCN) were successfully prepared as photocatalysts for the photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange and H2 evolution under visible light irradiation. The incorporation of FCN into Zn3In2S6 nanosheets significantly enhanced the photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution (reduction) and degradation of methyl orange (oxidation). And the best-performing Zn3In2S6/FCN composite (i.e., ZF3) exhibited enhanced visible-light-driven photocatalytic methyl orange degradation efficiency of about 7.36 and 5.35 times higher than those of pure FCN and Zn3In2S6, respectively. Trapping experiments combined with electron spin resonance spectroscopy indicated that the active radicals (O2− and OH) and oxidizing h+ were responsible for the photocatalytic reaction. Meanwhile, the cumulative H2 evolution quantity by ZF3 sample via photocatalytic H2 evolution from water splitting under 5 h of light irradiation reached 2553.9 μmol.g−1, which was 3.66 times higher than that of Zn3In2S6 (698.2 μmol.g−1). Cyclic tests demonstrated the stability of the ZF3 composite over five cycles of repeated use. These excellent performances were found to be attributable to the remarkable charge carrier separation between FCN and Zn3In2S6, with the aid of interfacial heterojunction structures. Based on the above results, the possible photocatalytic reaction mechanisms of ZF3 composite in both pollutant degradation and H2 evolution from water splitting were also proposed. This study provides new insights into the preparation of highly-efficient hierarchical composite photocatalysts, which are promising for implementation in wide-ranging environmental applications.},

These challenges are also the current research focus on FO. This paper aims to review the recent developments in FO, focusing on the opportunities and challenges. It begins with discussing the advantages of the FO process over pressure-driven membrane processes. These potential advantages lie in FO's low energy consumption, low fouling propensity, reduced or easy cleaning, low costs, high salt rejection and high water flux. Next, the recent applications of FO, as the outcomes of the above advantages, are described. The key part of this review is a detailed discussion of five critical challenges faced by FO and their relationships. Finally, the future of FO is viewed.

	abstract = {Nonsolvent-induced phase separation (NIPS) and thermally induced phase separation (TIPS) are widely adopted membrane fabrication methods with both advantages and drawbacks. In an attempt to combine the benefits of both processes, in this work, a novel hybrid method, i.e., nonsolvent thermally induced phase separation (NTIPS), was proposed to fabricate polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes by careful choice of a water-soluble diluent, ε-caprolactam (CPL), for membrane distillation (MD) applications. Combined with polymer/diluent compatibility analysis, a series of PVDF/CPL binary solutions was studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and polarized light microscopy (PLM) to identify an appropriate PVDF concentration range (\&lt;30 wt\% PVDF) for the fabrication of membranes with desirable pore structures in the NTIPS process. The SEM images showed an asymmetric structure of NTIPS membranes with an ultrathin top skin layer of 0.5 μm and a highly porous support layer with a bicontinuous network of pores. Based on the X-ray diffractometry (XRD) examination and attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic (ATR-FTIR) analysis for the NTIPS membranes, combined NIPS and TIPS mechanisms were identified through the formation of different PVDF crystalline phases at different locations (surface and bulk layers). Further characterization confirmed that, compared to the currently reported MD membranes, the novel NTIPS membrane exhibited a much higher overall porosity of 86\% and a higher liquid entry pressure (LEP) above 3.5 bar, as well as exceptional mechanical strength, which are desirable characteristics for MD applications to avoid membrane pore wetting and to ensure high salt rejection. Through the performance evaluation of NTIPS membranes using synthetic seawater (3.5 wt\% sodium chloride solutions) in direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD), superior permeation flux of 85.6 kg m−2 h−1 at a feed temperature of 80 °C and a salt rejection rate greater than 99.99\% were achieved. This study is expected to have profound implications in the development of PVDF membrane fabrication methods not only for MD applications but also for other membrane processes.},

	title = {Development of novel hollow fiber membranes for forward osmosis applications},
	url = {http://repository.ntu.edu.sg/handle/10356/50763},
	abstract = {Forward osmosis (FO) process has been gaining popularity in recent years as a potential alternative to pressure-driven membrane processes such as reverse osmosis (RO) for water desalination and wastewater reclamation. However, the main drawback of FO system is permeate flux decline due to internal concentration polarization (ICP) when conventional RO membranes are used. The only commercially available FO flat sheet membrane developed by Hydration Technologies Inc (HTI) presented low water permeation flux. Therefore, the development of novel FO membranes with optimized structure to reduce ICP has become a critical issue to facilitate FO practical applications.
In this study, single layer asymmetric microporous hollow fiber membranes were fabricated using Torlon polyamide-imide (PAI) material as the porous support followed by a simple polyelectrolyte cross-linking using polyethyleneimine (PEI) to produce hollow fiber membranes with a positively charged nanofiltration (NF)-like selective layer. The newly developed PAI hollow fiber membranes show a pure water permeability of 2.19-2.25 l/m2.h.bar and reasonable NaCl and MgCl2 rejections of 49\% and 94\% at 1 bar, respectively. It is also found that in FO processes, when using 0.5 M MgCl2 as a draw solution and de-ionized (DI) water as the feed in the active layer facing feed water (AL-FW) configuration at 23°C, the water fluxes of two PAI FO hollow fiber membranes are 8.36 and 9.74 l/m2.h, respectively, and the salt to water flux ratio (Js/Jv) of the two membranes is smaller than 0.4 g/l, which is lower than the data of 0.85 g/l for commercial HTI FO membrane. Different from a neutral membrane, the positively charged FO membrane provides double electric repulsions to the salt transfer through the membrane in the AL-FW configuration, leading to a reduction of salt penetration, while in the active layer facing draw solution (AL-DS) configuration, the positive charges facilitate salt transportation. This study provides a simple and effective approach to make hollow fibers with a NF-like skin suitable for FO applications.
An improvement for the single layer PAI hollow fiber membranes has been carried out by incorporating a negatively charged polyelectrolyte layer on the selective skin, aiming to enhance membrane antifouling property. This new type of PAI FO membrane possesses pure water permeability of 3.7-4.3 l/m2.h.bar and Na2SO4 rejection up to 85\% at 1 bar. In the FO process, the membranes can achieve water flux of 17 and 12 l/m2.h for the AL-DS and AL-FW configurations, respectively, using a 2000 ppm Na¬2SO4 aqueous solution as the feed and 0.5 M Na2SO4 as the draw solution. When the feed contained 1000 ppm bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 2000 ppm Na2SO4, a steady water flux of 11 l/m2.h can be maintained using 0.5 M Na2SO4 as the draw solution at ambient temperature of 23 °C. The approach of making FO membranes developed in this study offers the advantages of simple fabrication process, tailorable selective layer and promising membrane performance for protein-contained wastewater treatment by FO process.},

With the increase of the shear rate, the water permeation flux was increased and then maintained nearly the same level. The MWCO and CO2 absorption flux of the hollow fiber membranes spun from 17 wt.\% PVDF dope at different shear rates were almost the same. But for the hollow fibers spun from 20 wt.\% PVDF dope, increasing the shear rate in the spinning process resulted in bigger geometric mean diameters, larger MWCO and higher CO2 absorption flux. Compared with the hollow fiber membranes spun with high polymer concentration (20 wt.\%), the hollow fibers spun from low PVDF concentration (17 wt.\%) had a wider pore size distribution and bigger pores, which dominated the MWCO of hollow fiber membranes and presented a significant influence on the membrane performance.},

The LbL consists of layers of polyanion (polystyrenesulfonate, PSS) and polycation (polyallylamine hydrochloride, PAH), cross-linked with glutaraldehyde solution. The modified membranes were subsequently characterized in terms of morphology, FTIR, surface charge, pore size distribution, water permeability and salt rejection.

	title = {Design and fabrication of superhydrophobic membranes by electrospinning for direct contact membrane distillation},
	abstract = {Fast global population growth, serious environmental pollution and rapid economic developments have resulted in water scarcity around the world. Membrane distillation (MD) processes were considered as an attractive technology to treat waste water, recycle polluted water and provide more freshwater resources. This thesis provides a brief review on the research and developments of MD process, commercial MD membranes and lab-fabricated MD membranes. As the electrospun composite nanofibrous membranes have great potential to be used in MD due to their unique structural features, the complex electrospinning process has also been reviewed, including the materials and operating parameters which could control nanofiber formation, and various designs of electrospun apparatus which can produce nanofiber membranes with different appearances. However, it is found that limited works have been carried out to fabricate MD membranes by electrospinning. 
In this work, poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) nanofiber membranes were fabricated through electrospinning for direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) as a first trial. The effects of PVDF dope concentration, inorganic salt additives, sprayer’s moving speed, and chamber moisture on the properties of resultant membranes were investigated. It also illustrates the importance of processing parameters and heat-press post-treatment, and demonstrates that the heat-press post-treatment improved membrane integrity significantly and enhanced permeate flux in DCMD process. All the electrospun nanofiber membranes possessed high water contact angles (between 135° to 142°) due to their high surface roughness. The post-treated PVDF nanofiber membranes were able to present a steady water permeation flux of 21 kg m-2h-1 throughout the entire testing period of 15 h, using a 3.5 wt\% NaCl solution as the feed under the feed and permeate inlet temperatures of 323 K and 293 K, respectively.
However, PVDF nanofiber membranes without hydrophobic additives or surface modification do not have sufficient anti-wetting performance. Further treatment of PVDF nanofiber should be carried out to impart them with better wetting resistance and long-term stability. Two types of superhydrophobic PVDF nanofiber membranes, integrally-modified and surface-modified PVDF membranes, have been successfully fabricated by electrospinning followed by surface modification, which includes dopamine surface activation, silver nanoparticle deposition and hydrophobic treatment. The modification is convenient because of mild reactions and wide applicability. The characterizations revealed that the modifications have altered the membrane surface morphology and topology, and made the membrane superhydrophobic due to their hierarchical structures. Compared with unmodified membrane, the integrally-modified membrane (I-PVDF) can achieve a high and stable MD water flux of 31.6 kg m-2h-1 using a 3.5 wt\% NaCl as the feed solution while the feed and permeate temperatures were fixed at 333 K and 293 K, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this result is superior to all other PVDF flat sheet membranes tested under the same or similar conditions, which is believed to be attributed to the open surface pore structure and the thin thickness of the PVDF nanofiber membrane with the aid of electrospinning. The superhydrophobic nature of the membrane surface brought by the integral modification on all nanofibers renders the membrane anti-wetting property while remaining high water flux.
Moreover, inspired by the unique structure of lotus leaf, a novel strategy is developed to construct composite nanofiber membranes with robust superhydrophobicity and high porosity suitable for use in MD. The newly developed membrane consists of a superhydrophobic silica-PVDF composite selective skin formed on PVDF porous nanofiber scaffold via electrospinning. This fabrication method could be easily scaled up due to its simple preparing procedures. The effects of silica diameter on membrane contact angle, sliding angle and MD performance were investigated thoroughly. For the first time, the DCMD tests demonstrate that the newly developed membranes are able to present stable high performance over 50 h of testing time, and the superhydrophobic selective layer exhibits excellent durability in ultrasonic treatment and continuous DCMD test. It is believed that this novel design strategy has great potential for MD membrane fabrication.
Additionally, to further improve the wetting repellent property of superhydrophobic membranes, 3-dimensional (3D) superhydrophobic membranes were developed as a possible solution. Moreover, since highly porous nanofiber membranes usually suffer from insufficient mechanical property, which have adverse impact on membrane packing in the module, thus, a dual-layer membrane was fabricated by electrospinning 3D superhydrophobic composite layers on a non-woven support to improve its wetting resistance and enhance mechanical robustness Another type of dual-layer superhydrophobic composite membranes consisting of PVDF nanofibrous support and an ultrathin 3D superhydrophobic selective layer was prepared to compare with the as-fabricated non-woven-supported superhydrophobic dual-layer membrane. All these membranes exhibit superhydrophobicity towards distilled water, salty water, oil-water mixture and beverages, which enables them to be used not only for desalination but also for other concentrating treatments. Compared with nanofiber-supported dual-layer membranes, the non-woven-supported membranes exhibit higher mechanical strength as a result of excellent combination with non-woven support and better long-term performance because of the thicker 3D superhydrophobic structure. The morphology, pore size, porosity, mechanical properties as well as liquid enter pressure of water of these superhydrophobic composite membranes and commercial PVDF membrane are measured and compared. The possible wetting procedures of the as-prepared superhydrophobic dual-layer membranes are also illustrated in this study.

	abstract = {The aqueous-aqueous membrane extractive process is an ideal approach to remove recalcitrant organics from highly saline and harsh wastewater. However, it is still challenging to develop highly-efficient membranes for the extractive process. In this work, three-tiered polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)/polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanofiber/non-woven fabric composite membranes were prepared by electrospinning and electrospray-printing for the first time. An ultrathin and defect-free PDMS selective layer was fabricated on the surface of a PVDF/non-woven fabric nanofibrous substrate by electrospray-printing. Meanwhile, the thicknesses of the PDMS selective layer were able to be finely controlled by electrospray-printing. The novel three-tiered composite membrane \#N3-1 with the thinnest PDMS layer (3.0 ± 0.4 μm) and a thin and porous supporting layer showed an exceptionally high k0 of 37.9 ± 2.8 × 10-7 m/s and an excellent salt rejection above 99.95\% over a 105-h continuous operation. Moreover, \#N3-1 exhibited outstanding k0 at feed pH of 2 and 11 over 100 h without loss of salt rejection. In addition, the effects of the non-woven fabric supporting layer on the phenol mass transfer coefficient (k0, m/s) of resultant extractive membranes were also studied symmetrically. A thin and porous non-woven supporting layer \#N3 was capable to improve k0 of resultant composite membrane significantly.},

We recently proposed solvent-based membrane contactor (SMC) for high ({\textgreater}90\%) methane recovery over a wide temperature range and net-energy production. Here, we investigate the methane recovery efficacy of the SMC process by using an AnMBR effluent from treating food waste leachate. We observed almost identical methane transfer kinetics to the process employing foulant-free methane-saturated feed solutions, with {\textgreater}92\% methane recoveries, showing that organic foulants have insignificant impacts on the methane transport in the SMC. We then performed two different membrane contactor experiments: direct-contact membrane-distillation (DCMD, with transmembrane water vapor flow) and SMC (no water vapor flow). From the negligible fouling observed in the SMC experiment, opposite to the DCMD, we elucidate that the absence of water vapor flow renders the SMC process intrinsically robust to membrane fouling. With the low fouling propensity of the SMC process under highly fouling environments, our study highlights the feasibility of SMC processes to enhance the energy production in mainstream anaerobic wastewater treatment processes.},

Unlike RO applications, in which the transducer was placed above the membrane to detect external fouling on the top surface of membrane, the transducer was placed below the membrane to enable detection of internal and external fouling in an FO application. The amplitude changes and arrival-time shifts in UTDR were more sensitive than the flux decline as an indicator of FO fouling. In the active-layer facing the feed solution (AL-FS) mode, the cake-layer thickness obtained via the differential UTDR signal agreed well with the mass-balance data. The Short-Time-Fourier-Transform (STFT) analysis permitted decomposing the non-overlapping peaks that revealed a significant decrease in the amplitudes of the high-frequency components due to the grain-scattering effect in the active-layer facing the draw solution (AL-DS) mode. In contrast, the frequency distribution remained unchanged in the AL-FS mode. The total reflected power (TRP) calculations for the arrival-times and principal peaks in the frequency-domain correlated well with the overall fouling and internal fouling, respectively.},

	abstract = {Membrane distillation (MD) has attracted increasing attention for seawater and brackish water desalination, wastewater treatment, and concentration of juices and pharmaceutical solutions due to its feasibility of using low-grade energy and achieving high solute rejection. However, the successful implementation of MD technology is still impeded by membrane wetting resulted from membrane scaling by inorganic crystals and membrane fouling by organic matters in the feed solutions, especially when dealing with challenging wastewaters. Herein, this study describes a novel strategy to develop a robust and superhydrophobic membrane via electrospinning followed by electrospray to enhance membrane anti-wetting properties caused by scaling and fouling. The robust superhydrophobic membrane PDMS-3 comprised a superhydrophobic surface layer fabricated by electrospraying a PVDF/PDMS/silica fume blended solution and an electrospun nanofibrous PVDF support. The newly developed membrane PDMS-3 not only exhibited an outstanding superhydrophobicity with a water contact angle of 170⁰ ± 1⁰, but also showed a unique anti-abrasive feature, which still possessed a slippery superhydrophobic property after 40 abrasion cycles. Moreover, the DCMD tests revealed that this rigid superhydrophobic surface rendered PDMS-3 with the best anti-scaling and anti-fouling properties compared to the nanofibrous and commercial PVDF membranes. It could achieve a superior MD flux of 28 kg m−2 h−1and a stable salt rejection above 99.99\% during a continuous 160-h DCMD operation when the feed and permeation solutions were 3.5 wt\% NaCl solution at 333K and distillate water at 293 K, respectively. These results underline the importance of anti-abrasive superhydrophobic membrane development to deal with wastewaters containing diverse inorganic and organic matters via MD.},

	abstract = {The trade-off between water permeability and selectivity is considered as the biggest challenge during membrane fabrication for water purification. The aquaporin (AQP)-based biomimetic membrane has been proven to have both enhanced water permeability and improved selectivity due to the unique features of the AQP protein water channel that permits water molecules and rejects all other components. In this study, a prototype forward osmosis (FO) Aquaporin Inside™ membrane (AIM) was evaluated in terms of intrinsic filtration properties, membrane surface chemistry and fouling behaviour, and compared with a commercial FO membrane. The surface of the prototype AIM appeared to be a modified semi-aromatic polyamide layer instead of fully-aromatic as in other conventional FO products. As a result, compared to the commercial FO membrane, the prototype AIM shows higher water flux and comparable reverse salt flux (RSF) when tested under identical conditions. Due to the lower RSF, the AIM had less organic fouling by a sodium alginate solution when calcium chloride (CaCl2) was used as the draw solution (DS). The membrane integrity of the prototype AIM was maintained after repeated cycles of fouling by high concentration of gypsum and physical cleaning tests. This demonstrates the possibility of using the AIM membrane for treating harsh feed solutions.},

	abstract = {Feed spacer is a mesh-like structure placed between membrane sheets to create channels for fluid
flow in a spiral wound membrane module (SWM). It has an important role in the hydrodynamic
conditions of a SWM, which serves to facilitate mass transfer in the feed channel by generating
vortex and promoting mixing. However, the challenges of commercial feed spacers include the
trade-off between mass transfer and pressure drop along the channel that leads to the rise in energy
demand as well as their impact on membrane fouling. With the advent of 3D printing, there is
greater design freedom for the development of novel spacers. This paper focuses on the design and
optimization of a novel spacer for SWM via 3D printing to maximise mass transfer while
minimising pressure drop and membrane fouling. Due to the capability of 3D printing to rapidly
prototype complicated and intricate structures, a series of existing, modified and innovative spacer
structures against commercial feed spacers were designed, printed and examined to identify the
basis form of spacer structure with the greatest potential. Eventually, the sinusoidal flutter designs
proved to generate higher flux, lower pressure drop and higher mass transport in contrast to the
commercial spacer. Therefore, the sinusoidal design is a potential spacer structure that could
surpass the performance of the commercial spacer after further investigation by varying the design
parameters to obtain the optimal design.},

To this end, we developed a numerical model for the 1-2 EERO process (one SSRO stage with two stages in CMCR: one nanofiltration (NF) stage followed by one terminal RO stage), then validated the model using performance data obtained from commercial RO projection software. Retentate recycle ratio was one of the key parameters to determine energy efficiency of EERO. In addition, the implementation of NF membranes in the first stage of CMCR yielded additional improvement in EERO performance and played an important role in determining optimum salt rejection. An optimal design of the NF stage was successfully achieved by hybridization of different NF membranes in a vessel (internally staged design, ISD). Under the conditions optimized, EERO exhibited not only greater energy efficiency (3–25\%), but lower concentration polarization (CP) and potentials of membrane fouling than conventional SSRO for ≥55\% overall recoveries because of reduced water flux in the lead elements (averagely 34\%). These findings can thus provide insight into optimal design and operation of the EERO process.},

The models can simulate flux decline, transmembrane pressure increase, and fouling thickness based on theoretical equations. However, the simulated fouling layer thicknesses have not been validated by in-situ observations on membrane surfaces because the membrane system is operated under a sealed and pressurized condition. In this study, humic acid fouling layers on nanofiltration and reverse osmosis membranes were monitored in-situ and in real-time using optical coherence tomography (OCT). The OCT system detected fouling layer growth over time, and showed that the compact and thick fouling layer had an estimated thickness of 80 µm. When comparing the thickness of the fouling layer between OCT and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, the OCT images showed values that were approximately 8 times higher than those of the SEM images. By comparing the obtained fouling thickness values with the estimated results, two existing models (Faridirad model and pore blockage-cake filtration model) were validated in terms of root mean square error (RMSE), Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), and coefficient of determination (R2). Both models showed similar high R2 (≥0.97) and low RMSE ({\textless}10-5) values, but the pore blockage-cake filtration model had lower AIC values than the Faridirad model. This study highlighted that the in-situ and real-time monitoring of fouling thickness can provide significant information for developing an accurate and precise membrane model.},

The concentration of Acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) in the bulk liquid was significantly higher during the ‘TMP jump’ period compared to QQB and control phases, while AHLs in the membrane foulants were remarkably lower in QQB phase compared to control phase. Furthermore, a much lower level of soluble microbial production (SMP) was observed in QQB phases. Extracellular polymeric substance (EPS), protein in particular, was reduced by 39.73–80.58\% in the cake layer of the membrane from QQB phases. Significant changes of organic functional groups were observed in cake layer from QQB membrane as compared with that from control membrane. At the end of operation, bio-polymer (BP), building blocks (BB) and low molecular weight (LMW) organic matters increased in the foulant from control phases but such increase was not observed in QQB phase.

However, fouling of low-pressure NF membranes restricts their application in providing high quality feed to subsequent RO process. In this study, an antifouling low-pressure NF membrane was designed and fabricated via rapid co-deposition of polydopamine (PDA)/polyethylenimine (PEI) on electrostatic layer-by-layer (LBL) assembled polyethersulfone (PES) flat sheet membrane followed by crosslinking with glutaraldehyde. The optimized resultant membrane (LBL-cPP) presented approximately 11 LMH/bar pure water permeability with more than 90\% rejection divalent cations under 2 bar pressure. The newly developed selective layer exhibited excellent antifouling performance and chemical stability ascribing to the inherent hydrophilicity of PDA/PEI and dual covalent reaction of PDA with the LBL layer. By feeding real municipal wastewater, the LBL-cPP membrane also achieved superior permeate quality, leading to lower RO fouling rate in subsequent RO unit as compared to commercial NF 270 membrane. Further organic foulant analysis indicated that 96.8\% of dissolved organic carbons were effectively removed by the LBL-cPP membrane. Specifically, the novel NF membrane demonstrated high removal rate ({\textgreater}93\%) for foulants with low molecular weights which was largely responsible for RO fouling, while maintaining the desired flux recovery rate and reduced cleaning frequency. This study demonstrates the potential of PDA/PEI modified low-pressure NF membranes in designing efficient and sustainable water reclamation technology.},

It would be desirable if the membrane fouling could be controlled so that the operation for waste activated sludge thickening can be more sustainable. In this study, the role of polyaluminium chloride conditioning in improving performance of forward osmosis for waste activated sludge thickening and its effects on fouling mitigation were investigated. The results show sludge can be concentrated up to 52.5 g L−1 at the end of each operation cycle. In comparison with raw waste activated sludge, sludge thickening efficiency and water recovery flux of forward osmosis were greatly enhanced by polyaluminium chloride conditioning. Polyaluminium chloride facilitated the reduction of sludge capillary suction time, extracellular polymeric substances content, loosely bound extracellular polymeric substances in particular, which had significant impact on mitigating membrane fouling. As a result, long-term stable operation of sludge thickening without substantial flux decline was successfully obtained. In addition, seawater brine which holds high osmotic pressure could be an alternative draw solution.},

The build-up of salts (i.e., Ca, Mg, PO4) is a function of SRT, hydraulic retention time (HRT) and membrane rejection. Despite the accumulation of salts, both NF-MBRs at SRT of 30 and 60 days, achieved (i) similar biodegradation efficiency; (ii) excellent organic removal ({\textgreater} 97\%); and (iii) excellent ammonia removal ({\textgreater} 98\%). Extending the SRT could improve the microbial bio-flocculation capability, but did not influence the microbial activity, viability, and community structure. However, more severe membrane fouling was observed in the NF-MBR with elevated salt levels, which was attributed to the greater formation of calcium phosphate scale and Ca-polysaccharides complex (i.e., irreversible fouling layer) as well as the cake-enhanced-osmotic-pressure (CEOP) effect. Although both NF-MBRs produced comparable quality of permeate, a higher RO membrane fouling rate was observed when the permeate of NF-MBR with SRT at 60 days was fed to the RO system, implying organic compositions in NF-MBR permeate may influence RO performance.},

The results showed that the MBR systems achieved excellent organic removals ({\textgreater}95\%) and the anoxic-aerobic MBR could also remove ∼57\% of soluble total nitrogen. Compared to the aerobic MBR, the AFMBR displayed better membrane performance with less energy consumption, attributed to effective membrane scouring by liquid-fluidized GAC particles. Furthermore, a zeolite column was employed to remove ammonia in the AFMBR permeate, which ensured comparable organic and nitrogen levels in the feeds to RO units in the two processes. Although less organic substances and microbial cells were accumulated on the RO membrane fed with AFMBR-zeolite column effluent, its fouling rate (∼6.5 ± 2.2 bar/day) was significantly greater than that fed with anoxic-aerobic MBR permeate (∼1.1 ± 1.5 bar/day). This may be associated with more severe inorganic colloidal fouling on the RO membrane, illustrated by an electrical impedance spectroscopy fouling monitoring system.},

	abstract = {Biocatalytic nanofiltration (NF) membranes incorporated with enzymes show high capacity for micropollutants (MPs) removal. However, there remains significant challenges such as the lack of molecular-level tailoring for skin layer design and effective strategy for enzyme immobilization. In this work, layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly based biocatalytic NF membranes were fabricated for bisphenol (BPA) removal by immobilizing laccase into the skin layer during the LBL polyelectrolytes assembly with controlled crosslinking and immobilization. This strategy enables simultaneous enzyme immobilization and NF skin layer formation. Three laccase immobilization strategies (i.e., post immobilization, post crosslinking, and post crosslinking and immobilization) on skin layer were explored to prepare NF membrane for evaluating BPA removal efficiency. The post immobilization was identified as the optimal strategy, which endowed the biocatalytic NF membrane with a pure water permeability of 10.9 ± 0.4 LMH/bar and MgCl2 rejection of 97.2 ± 0.3\% under 2 bar pressure, alongside competitive laccase loading (238.8 ± 3.5 μg/cm2) and laccase activity (0.6 U/cm2). The optimal biocatalytic NF membrane exhibited an improvement in BPA removal of 79.5\% under an incubation mode and 92.5\% under a full recycling mode. The removal efficiencies were {\textasciitilde}240\% higher than that of the unmodified LBL membrane and clearly comparable to other reported biocatalytic membranes. This performance was attributed to the synergistic effect of membrane rejection, adsorption and laccase catalysis. The optimal biocatalytic NF membrane was found to be robust after six cycles within 14 days, while maintaining a relatively high BPA removal efficiency and salt rejection. Overall, our results open up a new avenue for enzyme immobilization into the skin layer of membranes for designing high-efficient biocatalytic NF membranes for MPs removal.},

Membranes for water treatment experienced significant breakthroughs owing to the unique benefits of additive manufacturing.

However, there were conflicting reports on the feasibility of 3D printing, especially for membranes. Some research groups stated that technology limitations today made it impossible to 3D print membranes, but others showed that it was possible by successfully fabricating prototypes. This paper will provide a critical and comprehensive discussion on 3D printing specifically for spacers and membranes. Various 3D printing techniques will be introduced, and their suitability for membrane and spacer fabrication will be discussed. It will be followed by a review of past studies associated with 3D-printed spacers and membranes. A new category of additive manufacturing in the membrane water industry will be introduced here, known as hybrid additive manufacturing, to address the controversies of 3D printing for membrane. As AM technology continues to advance, its possibilities in the water treatment is limitless. Some insightful future trends will be provided at the end of the paper.},

The membranes were fabricated using different solvents: N,N-dimethylformamide (PVDF-DMF), 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (PVDF-NMP) and triethyl phosphate (PVDF-TEP). Dielectric strength analysis and piezo-response force microscopy (PFM) revealed that PVDF-DMF, displaying finger-like morphology, presented highest dielectric strength and desired piezoelectric properties. The presence of macrovoids in PVDF-NMP resulted in weak dielectric strength. Electrical poling was performed, enhancing the piezoelectric properties of membranes. No noticeable change in microstructure was observed for PVDF-NMP after poling. However, cross-section morphology of PVDF-DMF visibly changed from finger-like to drop-like cavities. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy and PFM showed improvements in fraction of β phase and piezoelectric coefficient d33 after poling. Cross-flow filtration experiments using colloidal silica were performed to investigate effect of electrical signal (10 Vpp, 500 Hz) on the membranes. It showed negligible effect on performance of unpoled PVDF-DMF, while 46\% increase in critical flux and 66\% reduction in transmembrane pressure increase (dTMP/dt) was observed for poled PVDF-DMF under electrical signal.},

Interfacial polymerization is an effective technique to synthesize high performance polyamide thin film membranes. However, it is still very challenging to apply this technique on ceramic hollow fibres or tubular membranes, especially when the substrate pore size is in the microfiltration range. In this study, we demonstrated that thin polyamide layer can be synthesized directly on microfiltration ceramic tubular membranes with a surface pore size of 0.1–0.2 μm via interfacial polymerization without an intermediate layer. A thin polyamide layer with a thickness 30–40 nm was coated on the inner surface of the ceramic substrate by circulating the monomers of branched polyethyleneimine (PEI), piperazine (PIP), and trimesoyl chloride (TMC) through the membrane lumen. The thin film layer showed good integration with the ceramic substrate and could withstand high pressure of at least 10 bar. The mechanical property of the polyamide layer was examined using AFM and the modulus was measured. The thin film composite membranes demonstrated excellent nanofiltration performance with a pure water permeability of 16–18 LMH bar−1 and a molecular weight cut-off of ∼250 Da. The membranes also showed good salt rejections ({\textgreater}90\%) to CaCl2, MgCl2 and MgSO4, and still maintained high rejections of MgCl2 and sucrose at elevated temperature of 80 °C. The use of highly inert ceramic substrates has enabled the application of polyamide membranes under more challenging conditions.},

In this study, polyamide-based hollow fibre composite members for low pressure OSN were successfully developed. Solvent resistant polyimide hollow fibre substrates were first prepared through a non-solvent induced phase separation process, followed by chemical cross-linking with hexamethylene diamine.

	abstract = {Anaerobic wastewater treatment processes are becoming increasingly widespread due to their advantages in sludge management and net energy consumption. One major reason behind the energy benefit of the mainstream anaerobic processes is methane (CH4) production. Nevertheless, over one-third of the produced CH4 typically remains in effluent streams in dissolved form. To recover the dissolved CH4 (dCH4) from anaerobic effluents, the membrane contactor (MC) process enabled by porous membranes offers a promising way. However, membrane wetting and fouling issues hinder the practical implementation of the concept. Here we report a wetting- and fouling-resistant hollow fiber membrane that can operate with realistic anaerobic effluents. Coating of a highly porous ({\textasciitilde}85\%) hollow fiber support with a conformal layer of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) provides resistance to wetting, but fouling persists. To tackle the fouling issue, we post-treated the uncured PDMS-coatings with PDMS-based amphiphilic copolymers with short (147 Da) or long ({\textasciitilde}1570 Da) side chains. Both types of post-treated membranes exhibited an improved performance when tested against effluent samples taken not only from an anaerobic membrane bioreactor but also from an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor. The membrane treated with the short-side-chain copolymer could sustain 7 days of continuous operation with UASB effluent with a performance loss of only {\textasciitilde}10\%. We observed that the fouling layers were much richer in proteins rather than subtances similar to humic and fulvic acids and microbial byproducts. Besides, we calculated that our wetting/fouling-resistant membranes provide a net energy benefit for the MC process (when the recovered CH4 is retrofitted to the process as fuel). Thus, our results suggest that the MC-based dCH4 recovery process is a viable alternative for industrial practices in case the demonstrated custom-designed membranes are employed.},

	abstract = {A membrane contactor has been considered as one of the most effective tools for biomethane (CH4) recovery from anaerobic effluents owing to its several strengths. However, without thoroughly understanding various factors ranging from operating parameters (e.g., liquid or gas flow rate) to membrane characteristics (e.g., porosity, pore size, hydrophobicity, inner diameter, membrane area, and fiber length), a membrane contactor could just break even, or even worse, may be operated at a loss before turning a profit. Much of the groundwork is required to make sure to gain net benefits while avoiding those sorts of pitfalls. Herein, we attempted to screen several factors ranging from operation-to membrane-related parameters to ensure whether they meet essential criteria. To be specific, this study covers the following aspects: i) the optimal gas-liquid flow rate (G/L) ratio to minimize both the gas-phase resistance and the dilution of the final sweep gas, ii) the combined effects of G/L ratio and mass transfer area (AM) on the energy recovery performance, iii) the influences of an inner diameter (di) and AM on the CH4 recovery (RECH4) and the net energy production, iv) the influences of the L, porous structure, AM, and hydrophobicity on the RECH4 and the energy output from the microturbine, v) the minimum criterion for the di to minimize the energy required for the liquid pump, and vi) correlation between the pore structure and pore clogging. Through the thorough studies, we drew nine useful and meaningful conclusions including the best G/L ratio (0.0425 at the AM of 1 m2), necessary requisites (porous structure, larger AM, and more hydrophobicity) for higher RECH4, the lower limit of a di (190 μm) to minimize the energy required for the liquid pump, and so on. We expect that this comprehensive study can help researchers and engineers opt for operation- and membrane-related parameters leading to the desirable performance of a membrane contactor for energy recovery from anaerobic effluents.},

	abstract = {Conventional mixed-matrix membranes (MMMs) possess a dense structure with a filler material uniformly dispersed within the polymer matrix to engineer the transport properties and achieve enhanced gas separation performances with respect to pure polymeric membranes. However, a dense membrane structure increases the transport resistance and undesirably requires a high filler loading to see a substantial enhancement in separation performances. To address this problem, we fabricated asymmetric MMMs that have a thin-selective layer of around 0.5 μm and a low loading (0.03–0.10 wt\%) of nitrogen-doped graphene (N-G) nanosheets. The presence of the nitrogen- and oxygen-containing functional groups on the N-G nanosheets ensured good compatibility between filler and polymer matrix, which resulted in strong polymer/filler interfacial adhesions. The N-G nanosheets were also found to be capable of migrating to the top of the membranes during phase inversion. Hence, despite the low filler loadings used in this work, the capacity of the dense selective layers was greatly enhanced. Based on our experimental results, 0.07 wt\% and 0.10 wt\% loading of N-G nanosheets can improve both O2/N2 (126.9\%) and CO2/N2 (45.8\%) selectivities with respect to pure polymeric membranes, resulting in O2/N2 separation performance surpassing the Robeson upper bound.},

A series of analyses (SEM, XPS, FT-IR, water contact angle and zeta potential) confirmed the successful synthesis Fe3+/TA-PIP deposition and polyamide (PA) layer. The resultant membrane exhibited water permeability of 13.73 LMH/bar and 89.52 \% for MgSO4 rejection. The fabrication was further improved by embedding modified graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets into the Fe3+/TA-PIP complex. The optimized nanocomposite membrane achieved a water permeability at 21.66 LMH/bar, along with a well maintained MgSO4 rejection at 91.25 \% and NaCl/MgSO4 selectivity (α) at 10.02 under 2 bar operation pressure.

	abstract = {Membrane compaction is commonly observed in polymeric membranes when subjected to elevated hydraulic pressure, but was rarely discussed in forward osmosis (FO) processes, since there was usually little hydraulic pressure difference across the membrane. In the current study, three TFC membranes were fabricated using hollow fiber substrates with varied water permeability to study the effect of the osmotic pressure on the TFC membranes. The TFC membranes were continuously tested in FO experiments for 24 h by using DI water as feed and NaCl solutions of different concentrations as draw solution, and their performances were checked again using fresh feed solutions. At the end of FO experiments, all TFC membranes experienced water flux and salt flux decline to different extents. The TFC membranes were characterized using SEM, TEM and AFM. Visible changes in the cross-section morphology and surface topography of the TFC membranes were observed after FO experiments. The observation suggested that the occurrence of membrane compaction could be associated with “negative pressure” build-up within the support layer of the TFC membranes. The current study could shed light on the important factors that should be considered during membrane fabrication and when establishing the testing protocols for the characterization of FO membrane.},

In this work, a novel double-skinned hollow fiber thin film composite (TFC) FO membrane has been successfully fabricated, which consists of a one-step prepared dual layer substrate and a thin inner selective layer formed via interfacial polymerization. The substrate consists of a relatively dense ultrafiltration (UF) outer layer and a porous UF inner layer, both of which were constructed from polyethersulfone (PES) as the substrate material by using dual-layer co-extrusion technique. Compared to the commercial and reported double-skinned FO membranes, the FO membrane developed in this work exhibited a higher permeate flux with humic acid solution as feed. Furthermore, the double-skinned FO membrane was applied in concentrating activated sludge using 0.5 M NaCl as draw solution, and a permeate flux at 5.4 L/m2h was achieved after 5 h operation, which was higher than or comparable to those of the reported FO membranes. Membrane autopsies and foulant analysis suggested that the dense UF skin layer helped to reject greater-sized organic foulants ({\textgreater} 300 Da).

The PDA modification facilitated the HKUST-1 even dispersion, thus resulting in better compatibility between the inorganic nanofillers and the organic matrix. The impact of HKUST-1 loadings on the overall performances of the resultant HKUST-1@PA/PES membranes was investigated. Introducing the mHKUST-1 nanofillers not only enhanced surface hydrophilicity and negative surface charges for the selective layer, which improved membrane's fouling resistance to humic acid (HA), but also led to nearly doubled water permeance when comparing with the pristine PA membrane (increasing from 3.51 to 6.94 Lm−2h-1bar−1), without obvious salt rejection deterioration ({\textasciitilde}98.2\% at 2 bar and 97.4\% rejections at 4 bar for 500/2000 ppm NaCl solutions, respectively). The integrity of the HKUST-1@PA/PES membrane was examined and verified after 30-days operation. Overall, the results achieved in this work demonstrate promising potential of the metal organic framework (MOF)-based TFN membranes used for desalination in low-pressure RO process. To sum up, this work has exhibited a facile method to incorporate the metal organic framework (MOF) into the PA layer, and the resultant MOF-based TFN membrane indicates its great potential for desalination in low-pressure RO process.},

At the centre of this technology, membranes are instrumental in offering a high contact area at the gas-liquid interface. Today, polymer-based membranes are the mainstream for GLMC applications owing to their well-established fabrication techniques and economic advantages. Herein, we aim to review the current progress in polymer-based membranes for GLMC processes. Specifically, we first provide a basic overview of the principles and background of GLMC. Next, we identify three of the biggest Achilles heels of polymer-based membranes for GLMC processes, namely, (1) membrane performances, (2) pore wetting, and (3) membrane fouling. To a certain extent, we contend that a large part of these challenges can be resolved by optimizing the membrane designs. As such, in the next section, we focus our attention on high-performance, antiwetting and antifouling membranes as potential solutions to address these challenges. From a membrane-centred perspective, the scope of our discussion covers extensively from membrane materials, morphologies, structures and configurations, surface modifications to novel membrane designs including composite and mixed-matrix membranes. Notably, as membrane fouling studies are still in the preliminary stage, attractive membrane designs such as Janus and omniphobic membranes are borrowed from membrane distillation process to gain greater insights into the potential solutions that can be adapted for GLMC processes.},

The physicochemical properties of membranes may synergistically affect GLMC performances, especially during the long-term operations. In this work, commercial polypropylene (PP) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) hollow fiber (HF) membranes were applied to explore the effects of their physicochemical properties on long-term CO2 absorption performances in a bench-scale GLMC rig. PP membranes with pore size of 19 nm, thickness of 0.046 mm, and porosity of 58\% achieved high CO2 flux when feeding pure CO2 (5.4 and 24.4×10-3 mol/m2 .s using absorbents of water and 1M monoethanolamine (MEA), respectively) whereas PVDF membranes with pore size of 24 nm, thickness of 0.343 mm, and porosity of 84\% presented a good CO2 separation performance from the simulated biogas using 1M MEA (6.8×10-3 mol/m2 .s and 99.9\% CH4 recovery). When using water as absorbent, the coupled phenomena of membrane wetting and fouling restricted CO2 transport and resulted in continuous flux loss during the long-term operations. When using MEA as absorbent, both PP and PVDF membranes suffered dramatic flux decline. A series of membrane characterization tests revealed that the morphology, pore size, hydrophobicity, and stability of selected commercial membranes were greatly affected by MEA attack during long-term operations. Therefore, the selection criterion of microporous membranes for high-efficiency and long-term stable CO2 absorption in GLMC processes was proposed. It is envisioned that this study can shed light on improving existing membrane fabrication procedures and the application of novel membrane surface modification techniques to facilitate practical applications of the GLMC technology.},

In this work, a composite hollow fiber (HF) membrane with an aminosilane-modified zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (mZIF-8) based dense skin layer was designed and synthesized for high-efficiency biogas upgrading in the GLMC process, by dispersing mZIF-8 nanocrystals into poly(dimethylsiloxane) matrix and then depositing on a porous polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) substrate. (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane was introduced to modify the ZIF-8 nanocrystals, thereby enabling the chemical bonding with PDMS chains for avoiding interfacial voids and further enhancing hydrophobicity. Compared with the control membrane, the newly developed mZIF-8 based composite membrane with a dense skin exhibited competitive hydrophobicity with a contact angle of 130°, ensuring its anti-wetting ability. It exhibited an enhanced biogas upgrading performance with the absorption fluxes of 2.3 and 3.8 × 10−3 mol m−2·s−1 using water and 1 M monoethanolamine (MEA) as absorbents, respectively (liquid velocity = 0.25 m s−1). In particular, a comparable selectivity of CO2/CH4 with the value of ∼20 was achieved by using MEA as absorbent in the GLMC process. A robust long-term stability of the mZIF-8 based composite HF membrane was also achieved in a 15-day operation. This work offers a new perspective for promoting CO2 mass transfer with mZIF-8 based composite HF membranes, thereby improving the biogas upgrading performance in GLMC applications.},

The co-deposition of PDA/PEI with amino functional groups was employed to amine-functionalize a PVDF substrate as support for subsequent in-situ CA immobilization by cross-linking with glutaraldehyde. This enhances the enzyme stability and prolongs its lifespan, thus facilitates CO2 hydration efficiency in the GLMC process. In this work, different immobilization CA protocols were compared based on the CA activity and activity recovery. For biocatalytic CA-m-PVDF membranes, the best activity of 498 U m−2 (membrane) and a corresponding activity recovery of 31.5\% were achieved (m(5 h)-PVDF as support, 0.67 (v/v)\% GLU as cross-linking agent, 600 μg mL−1 CA solution, pH 8.0, temperature at 25 °C, and 24 h reaction time). By using water as absorbent with a liquid velocity of 0.25 m s−1 in a bench-scale GLMC setup, a high-efficiency CO2 absorption flux of 2.5 × 10−3 mol m−2 s−1 was obtained, which was {\textasciitilde}165\% higher than that of the non-biocatalytic m-PVDF membrane. The long-term stability test showed a good enzyme activity for CO2 hydration capacity for the CA-m-PVDF membranes during 40 days of test duration. Overall, the results achieved in this work may provide promising insights into enzyme immobilization on polymeric supports for the development of high-efficiency biocatalytic membranes for CO2 capture in GLMC applications.},

	abstract = {Conventional biomimetic membranes for desalination are mostly fabricated by incorporating water channels using self-assembled lipid or polymer vesicles as key platforms for protein or water channel reconstitution. Herein, we propose a thin film composite nanofiltration membrane via an unconventional liposomes-assisted fabrication without the incorporation of protein or water channels. The polyamide skin layer containing liposomes was thinner and filled with wrinkles and nanovoids. As a result, compared with the liposome-free control membrane, our optimized liposome-assisted membrane was able to achieve an increased water permeability from 11.17 to 18.21 LMH/bar, alongside an excellent MgCl2 rejection of 95.87\% and a monovalent/divalent (NaCl/MgCl2) ion selectivity (α) of 18.2. Extensive membrane characterization showed that the liposome-assisted skin layer indeed exhibited a smaller thickness with an increased effective membrane area and a reduced surface hydrophobicity, which contribute towards a reduction in the hydrodynamic resistance of the polyamide layer. Furthermore, our approach of liposome-assisted thin film composite membrane is simpler and more scalable to fabricate without protein or water channels incorporation, rendering our design more attractive for future nanofiltration using vesicle-embedded biomimetic membranes.},

	abstract = {Demulsification of oil-in-water emulsions is challenging but significant for oily wastewater treatment, especially for surfactant-stabilized oil-in-water (S–O/W) emulsions. Electrospun nanofibrous membranes exhibit promising performance as demulsification medium but the underline mechanisms are still unclear. In this work, the effects of membrane pore size and nanofiber surface wettability on the demulsification of the S–O/W emulsions were investigated. Two polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) nanofibrous membranes with different nanofiber diameter (\#P2: 200 nm and \#P10: 1000 nm) were developed by electrospinning. The superhydrophilic membranes (\#Dopa-P2 and \#Dopa-P10) were obtained by coating polydopamine layers on both membranes \#P2 and \#P10. The silver nanoparticle deposition and subsequent fluorination were conducted on the surfaces of the polydopamine-activated membranes to prepare superhydrophobic nanofibrous membranes (\#Ag–P2 and \#Ag–P10). The superhydrophilic membrane \#Dopa-P10 with a membrane pore size matching the oil droplets performed the best demulsification result. The oil droplets size increased up to 15 times (from 6.5 ± 1.0 μm to 98 ± 7 μm) after passing through \#Dopa-P10. The underlying mechanism should be the superhydrophilic nanofibers possessed excellent affinity to the surfactants layer surrounding oil droplets, which could destroy the stable status and facilitate the coalescence of the oil droplets in S–O/W emulsions. The hydrophobic and superhydrophobic membrane \#P10 and \#Ag–P10 showed little coalescence effects as they exhibited a negative repulsive force to oil droplets. The physical cutting effect dominated the coalescence process when oil droplets passing through the membranes (\#P2, \#Dopa-P2, and \#Ag–P2) with pore size much smaller than oil droplets. The various surface wettability didn't show any obvious difference on the coalescence results.},

	abstract = {External concentration polarization (ECP) remains a pervasive challenge for submerged forward osmosis (FO) systems, as it critically reduces the water flux of membranes. In this study, we propose to use transverse vibration on hollow fiber membranes to effectively reduce the ECP and increase the FO water flux performance. The effects of different vibrating amplitude and frequency were investigated. Also, the vibration effect was evaluated under different draw solution concentrations, membrane orientations and draw solute types. Our results show increased water flux with increasing vibrating intensity (i.e., amplitude and frequency) while maintaining a constant specific reverse solute flux (Js/Jw). At the highest amplitude (1.2 cm) and frequency (3 Hz) used, the mass transfer coefficient is increased from 0.7 × 10−5 m s−1 (at no vibration) to 1.8 × 10−5 m s−1, which falls within the optimal flux range as determined from our FO modelling results. The increment in mass transfer coefficient is found to be closely related to the improved hydrodynamic conditions due to vibration, and less dependent on the membrane orientation and draw solution concentration. In addition, both modelling and experimental results show that maintaining a reasonably high mass transfer coefficient is especially important for FO process with severe ECP conditions, such as when dilutive ECP is present (i.e., active-layer-facing-feed-solution orientation) or when a high water flux is applied (usually in the active-layer-facing-draw-solution orientation). However, the severe ECP arising from large draw solutes (e.g., larger sized polymer with low diffusivity and high viscosity) might not gain greater benefits from the vibration or improved hydrodynamic conditions.},

	abstract = {Hydrophobic membranes suffer from wetting and scaling when treating hypersaline brine using membrane distillation (MD). Thus omniphobic membranes with re-entrant surfaces have been developed by diverse modifications to enhance anti-wetting/scaling properties. However, those post-modifications usually sacrifice membrane permeability in spite of improved stability. In this work, omniphobic membranes were fabricated by decorating polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanofibrous membranes with different silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) followed by fluorination. Compared to unmodified nanofibrous and commercial PVDF membranes, both smaller SiNPs coated membrane \#P-Min and larger SiNPs coated membrane \#P-Max can perfectly sustain liquids with low surface tensions on their surfaces without wetting. In contrast to \#P-Max with an oil contact angle of 136 ± 1°, \#P-Min exhibited better oleophobicity with an oil contact angle of 152 ± 1°. In addition, the rigidity of their omniphobic properties was confirmed by testing in harsh conditions. Moreover, \#P-Min successfully overcame the trade-off relation between membrane permeability and rejection with an enhanced MD flux due to more effective water evaporation area on membrane surface and a higher membrane porosity. While \#P-Max was wetted by a hypersaline feed solution composed of 25 wt\% NaCl, \#P-Min could maintain a stable flux of 15 L m−2h−1 in a continuous 7-h MD operation, which proved its excellent performance for brine treatment. Furthermore, \#P-Min exhibited less scaling tendency when feed was a saturated gypsum solution. Compared to \#P-Max, the better anti-scaling properties of \#P-Min should be due to its higher surface energy barrier, better slippery property and less solid-liquid contact area, which effectively impede crystal nucleation and attachment.},

	abstract = {Although a highly porous support membrane has attracted increasing attention as an alternative to enhance the water permeability of a thin-film composite (TFC) membrane without compromising salt rejection, its feasibility has not ever been tested in seawater desalination. This study explored the availability and potential of a highly porous microstructured (HPμS) support membrane as a support for a seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) membrane. Our lab-made membranes, TFC-HPμS, exhibited a higher water permeability of 1.62 L m−2 h−1 bar−1 as compared with most of the state-of-the-art SWRO membranes recently reported in the literature, while achieving comparable NaCl rejection (99\%) in SWRO test condition (55 bar, 35,000 mg L−1 of NaCl). This excellent performance is thought to stem from the HPμS support endowing a TFC membrane with comparable mechanical properties to that of existing support used for conventional SWRO membrane and shortened effective diffusion pathway of water molecules over the active layer. The robustness and enhanced mechanical strength of the TFC-HPμS membrane are attributed to its narrow and regularly arranged finger-like structure ensuring the even distribution of local stresses, thereby eliminating the presence of stress convergence points. The shortened effective diffusion pathway was estimated to be achieved mainly by less localized surface pores due to the HPμS support's highly porous surface with a larger number of even distributed surface pores. This study potentially opens up another workable pathway in the fabrication of SWRO membranes with enhanced performance without significant sacrifice of the selectivity.},

	abstract = {Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) has received growing attention in hollow fiber membrane preparation for water production and wastewater treatment due to its excellent physical and chemical properties. Currently, PVDF hollow fiber membranes prepared via the conventional non-solvent phase separation (NIPS) method are often subjected to the formation of macrovoids, resulting in a broad pore size distribution and weak mechanical strength. Another method—thermally induced phase separation (TIPS) has gained renewed interest as it can produce robust membrane with a narrow pore size distribution. However, limited studies on TIPS were focused on the control over the surface pore structure, which is the key to the selectivity and permeability of membranes. Therefore, the development of a novel method to fabricate membranes with tailorable surface pore size and strengthened structure is critical for the membranes applied in the water industry.  
This research aims to develop PVDF-based hollow fiber membranes via novel thermally induced phase separation. Firstly, the basic understanding of TIPS process was acquired by fabricating the hollow fiber membranes prepared using mild diluents. Subsequently, hydrophobically enhanced hollow fiber membranes with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) addition were developed via TIPS method for direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD). Further, a novel hybrid method involving NIPS and TIPS (N-TIPS) was explored by using mixed diluents. Finally, the N-TIPS method was used to develop hydrophilically enhanced hollow fiber membranes with improved antifouling property by immobilizing Pluronic F127 particles.},

It has the potential to replace or be combined with traditional separation processes in industry to lower energy consumption and reduce waste. As hollow fiber membranes can offer advantages over flat sheet membranes and are not known to be commercially available for SRNF applications, this study aims to develop hollow fiber membranes that can perform nanofiltration in challenging polar aprotic solvents such as dimethylformamide (DMF) at a lower operating pressure than existing SRNF membranes. 

Polyamide-imide hollow fibers were fabricated by non-solvent induced phase separation and crosslinked using 3-aminopropyl trimethoxysilane (APTMS) so that they were stable in DMF. The crosslinked membranes were characterized by their gel content, swelling property, contact angle and mechanical properties. A conditioning treatment with either isopropanol (IPA) or deionized (DI) water was found to affect the morphology and performance of the membranes. Nanofiltration tests were carried out under 2 bar using Rose Bengal (1017 Da) in IPA and DMF. The membranes were tested in continuous operation for 7 days and stable performance in terms of flux and rejection could be attained, showing their potential to be applied in SRNF processes effectively.},

	url = {https://dr.ntu.edu.sg//handle/10356/74607},
	abstract = {Treatment of organic-containing wastewater has drawn increasing attention in recent years. Among the major pollutants, phenol has become a rising concern due to its high toxicity and carcinogenicity. On the other hand, phenol is recognized as a valuable chemical for industrial application such as production of phenolic resins. Hence, research and development of treatment processes for effective removal and recovery of phenol from wastewater before discharge is of high interest. Among all the existing technologies, membrane process, particularly, the membrane-based aqueous-aqueous extractive process, has been evidenced to be a promising technology ascribed to its appealing features including independent operation of the receiving solutions, point-source treatment of industrial effluents and low energy consumption. However, one of the main challenges that impedes the application of the aqueous-aqueous extractive processes is the shortage of specially designed membranes capable of extracting the organic compounds into the receiving medium with high efficiency and excellent stability. This study aims to develop high-performance nanofibrous composite membranes for phenol removal in the aqueous-aqueous extractive processes. Three generations of polydimethylsiloxane/polyvinylidene fluoride (PDMS/PVDF) nanofibrous composite membranes have been developed with focus on fabrication of highly porous tiered electrospun nanofibrous membranes (ENMs) as the supportive layers, optimization of the PDMS macromolecular architectures through different cross-linking pathways, and incorporation of ZIF-8 as transport fillers in the PDMS matrix, respectively. The developed nanofibrous composite membranes exhibited progressive enhancement in k0 (overall mass transfer coefficient, OMTC) values from 4.1 ± 0.3 x 10-7 m/s in the 1st-generation membrane, 18.3 ± 1.3 x 10-7 m/s in the 2nd-generation membrane, to 35.7 ± 1.1 x 10-7 m/s in the 3rd-generation membrane for phenol removal from wastewater. In addition, the effects of PDMS coating solution preparation, pre-wetting agent for substrate, PDMS precursor molecular weight, cross-linker amount, ZIF-8 addition protocol, and ZIF-8 loading on the phenol removal efficiency were studied systematically. In conclusion, this thesis presents a detailed study on the design and development of high-performance nanofibrous composite membranes for phenol removal in the aqueous-aqueous extractive processes. The findings obtained from this study provide insights and guidelines for fabricating highly efficient membrane materials for organic removal and recovery in various membrane extractive processes.},

	title = {Fabrication of polyoxometalates functionalized polymeric membranes for the removal of organic pollutants from wastewater},
	url = {https://dr.ntu.edu.sg//handle/10356/66087},
	abstract = {The fast global population growth and intensive industrialization have resulted in increasing wastewater emission, which is pushing forward new developments for wastewater handling. Membrane separation is a proven technology for wastewater treatment, while integration of more functionalities (e.g. catalysis and adsorption) into the membrane may potentially present a more cost-effective and environmentally-friendly solution. Polyoxometalates (POMs), which possess versatile properties owing to their unique structures, can be used as promising candidates to functionalize membranes for the removal of organic pollutants from wastewater. Currently, the research on POMs functionalized membranes for wastewater treatment is in its infancy. We aimed to fabricate POMs functionalized polymeric membranes with more functionalities (e.g. catalytic wet air oxidation or adsorption) for the removal of organic pollutants from wastewater.

A novel catalytic membrane contactor (CMC) was firstly fabricated through incorporating POMs onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) hollow fiber membranes via a simple chemical deposition method. The Keggin type POMs ([PV2Mo10O40]5−) as catalysts were modified on the surface of the membranes through chemical assembly with a permanently charged polyelectrolyte. The degradation of phenol was conducted using the CMC under room conditions with air as green oxidant. A gas/catalyst/liquid interface was successfully built up and proved to enhance the catalytic efficiency.

In order to further obtain tailored nano-morphologies of POMs and chemical bonding with the membrane substrates, the self-assembly of rare-earth Anderson POMs on the surfaces of imide polymeric hollow fiber membranes (polyetherimide and polyamide-imide) was designed. The rare-earth Anderson POMs ([Gd(H2O)7Cr(OH)6Mo6O18]n) nanoparticles with controllable size and distribution were successfully constructed. The self-assembly of POMs was revealed to be a surface-induced growth process in which the generation of silanol groups on the membrane was indispensable for further hydrogen bonding (–OH•••POMs) and coordination bonding (–OH–Gd) interactions. This work provided a simple but practical method not only for the fabrication of novel POMs functionalized membranes, but also for the synthesis of POMs nanoarchitectures. The as-prepared POMs functionalized imide polymeric membranes as CMCs exhibited enhanced phenol degradation activities under mild conditions. The importance of the air overpressure to form the gas/catalyst/liquid interface during the catalytic process was further elucidated.

Besides the construction of nanoarchitectures of POMs which possessed the catalytic capabilities to degrade phenol under mild conditions, another novel nanoarchitecture based on [PV2Mo10O40]5− to form a surfactant encapsulated POMs (SEP) has been synthesized and further incorporated into the polymeric PVDF membrane. The SEP complex fabricated via a simple ion-exchange method was revealed to self-assemble into spherical nanoparticles. It can be easily blended into the PVDF matrix forming SEP incorporated composite membrane without agglomeration and leaching problems. The SEP incorporated composite membrane presented excellent anionic dye adsorption activity, which is for the first time reported as an intriguing property of the SEP. A regeneration scheme without loss of dye removal efficiency was further proposed for the SEP incorporated composite membrane.

Inspired by the previous studies about the construction of catalytic membranes and adsorptive membranes based on POMs, a unique POMs functionalized alumina/PEI hollow fiber membrane with both adsorptive and catalytic activities was further fabricated. The POMs functionalized membrane was developed through a novel sol-gel method including the fabrication of a robust alumina containing polyetherimide hollow fiber membrane followed by the generation of an amine-functionalized substrate for the incorporation of POMs. A two-step protocol, adsorptive separation and catalytic degradation, was designed for dye removal, realizing an excellent dye rejection with easy and economic membrane regeneration. This process can be further tailored owing to the flexible selection of POMs (e.g. [PW11O39Fe(H2O)]4−) for membrane functionalization.

In conclusion, this thesis presents the design and development of novel POMs functionalized polymeric membranes in terms of the utilization of different functionalization methods, studies of the modification mechanisms and investigations of distinctive functionalities with corresponding performances for the removal of organic pollutants. The current work contributes to the development of membrane fabrication and modification technology and provides a new possibility for their applications in wastewater treatment.},

	abstract = {Water, energy and environmental pollution remain as major global issues despite significant advancement in technology. Graphene quantum dots (GQDs), a unique zero-dimensional (0D) carbon nanomaterial, compose of analogous graphene nanostructure and have garnered strong research interests because of its unique electrical and chemical properties associated with quantum-confinement and edge effects. By exploiting these properties, the current dissertation aims to develop and study a series of novel carbon nanoarchitectures for energy conversion, water and environmental pollutant remediation. A unique 0D/0D nanoarchitecture, (M/GQDs)n (M=Au, Ag, Pt nanocrystals) multilayer composite, was synthesized by using an efficient yet simple layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly strategy, showing highly efficient selective catalytic and electrocatalytic methanol oxidation performances. The rational design of a nitrogen-doped GQDs/1D semiconductor (0D/1D) nanoarchitecture of a photoanode with simultaneous nitrogen doping and photosensitization of GQDs collaboratively contribute to enhanced performance in photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. Furthermore, covalent bonding of graphene oxide quantum dots (GOQDs) onto amino modified polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) (0D/2D) membrane has generated a new type of nano-carbon functionalized membrane with significantly enhanced antibacterial and antibiofouling properties. This thesis opens up a new platform for rational design and construction of a large variety of 0D/0D, 0D/1D, 0D/2D functional nanostructures for advanced sustainable energy, water and environmental applications.},

	title = {Performance enhancement of the membrane distillation process via membrane surface modification for surfactant-containing feed water},
	url = {https://dr.ntu.edu.sg//handle/10356/87654},
	abstract = {With its many advantages, direct-contact membrane distillation (DCMD) appears to hold potential for the recovery of high quality water from different industrial effluents. Porous hydrophobic polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes have been extensively used in DCMD operations. However, these PVDF membranes are vulnerable to membrane fouling and pore wetting in low surface tension feeds, restricting its application for water recovery from challenging industrial wastewaters. The mechanisms involved are not fully understood due to a lack of study on the interaction between different low surface tension contaminants and the membrane surface in the DCMD domain. To address these challenges, this work aims at developing a fundamental understanding of the relationship between surfactant-stabilized oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions and a PVDF membrane surface in DCMD operations. The results reveal that surfactant concentration and hydrophobicity had an influence on membrane fouling and wetting behaviors of these emulsions. Notably, surfactants with a lower hydrophilic-lipophilic balance value could make the PVDF membrane surface less hydrophobic and cause less severe fouling by restraining the adsorption of oil droplets on the membrane surface. These findings suggest that membrane surface modification is required to achieve fouling- and wetting-resistant properties for robust long-term applications. 

Inspired by mussels’ byssus with remarkable adhesive power that is neither degraded nor deformed in the marine environment, dopamine coating has emerged as an option for membrane surface modification. In this work, two composite hollow fiber membranes were fabricated, one by single-step co-deposition of polydopamine (PDA)/polyethylenimine and the other via accelerated oxidant-induced PDA deposition onto the surface of a commercial hydrophobic PVDF substrate. The successful deposition was verified using different characterization techniques. These composite membranes exhibited Janus wettability with its modified surface being underwater superoleophobic for preventing organics adhesion while insuring that unmodified pores beneath the surface remained hydrophobic for vapor transport. The anti-fouling and anti-wetting properties of both modified membranes were investigated via bench-scale DCMD experiments by feeding a series of low surface tension solutions. In comparison to the pristine PVDF membrane, the modified membranes demonstrated excellent fouling- and wetting-resistant properties in different surfactant solutions as well as O/W emulsions. This was ascribed to the formation of an interfacial hydration layer and deposition of functional groups within the membranes’ rough hierarchical structures. The PDA-decorated membrane was also used for seawater desalination, during which it maintained a stable flux and high salt rejection rate. Furthermore, the PDA-decorated membrane presented a flux enhancement of up to 70\% over the pristine PVDF membrane in 3.5 wt\% NaCl solution at 333 K. This study demonstrates the potential of both modified membranes for extended DCMD applications such as water recovery from industrial wastewater containing low surface tension substances.},

	abstract = {Concentration polarization results in significant reduction in the difference in osmotic pressure between the draw solution and the feed solution in forward osmosis (FO) and is regarded as a major challenge in the FO process. Hence, mitigating concentration polarization is essential for increasing the efficiency of the FO process. In the current study, vibration of hollow fiber (HF) membranes was systematically studied as a method for the mitigation of concentration polarization in submerged FO process. A membrane module consisting of polyether sulfone (PES) HF membranes with inner selective layer was designed and fabricated. Using a water flux model that takes into account the internal concentration polarization (ICP) and external concentration polarization (ECP) on both the lumen and shell sides of the HF membranes, the vibrating frequency and amplitude were evaluated with regards to the change of mass transfer coefficient. Results showed that when low vibration frequency and amplitude of (3 Hz and 1.2 cm) were applied, the mass transfer coefficient increases from 0.7×10-5 m/s (at no vibration) to 1.8×10-5 m/s, which approaches the optimal value as determined from the FO modelling results. The effects of the vibration of membranes were then evaluated in the active layer facing feed solution (AL-FS) and active layer facing draw solution (AL-DS) orientations. Results showed that in the AL-FS orientation, vibration could enhance mass transfer coefficient significantly at low water flux. However, in the AL-DS orientation, the enhancement of mass transfer coefficient was minimal at low water flux level due to minimal concentrative ECP present. Interestingly, there was significant improvement of mass transfer coefficient at high DS concentration/high water flux level attributed to the significant concentration polarization under high water flux condition. In addition, the vibration-assisted FO process was carried out using polyelectrolyte poly (sodium-4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS) as a draw solute. The change of draw solute to PSS has limited effects on the vibration, as the low diffusion coefficient and high viscosity of PSS offsets the benefits of vibration of membranes. In summary, this study demonstrated a facile method for mitigating concentration polarization in submerged FO process, whereby vibration of HF membranes at low frequency and amplitude could enhance FO water flux by improving hydrodynamic mixing and induce boundary layer disturbances at the shell side of submerged HF membranes. The method could possibly be adopted for improving FO efficiency in submerged osmotic processes.},

	title = {Development of novel composite hollow fiber membranes for {CO2} removal from biogas using membrane contactor},
	url = {https://dr.ntu.edu.sg//handle/10356/106556},
	abstract = {Biogas is a clean and renewable energy source in a carbon-constrained world. Carbon dioxide (CO2) capture is essential for upgrading biogas to increase energy density. The gas-liquid membrane contactor (GLMC) has been proposed and investigated as a promising alternative to conventional CO2 absorption techniques such as packed towers and bubble columns. Owing to its desirable properties such as hydrophobicity, suitable pore size, high porosity, good mechanical strength, and high thermal stability, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane has been extensively used in GLMC processes. However, PVDF membrane is vulnerable to wetting, swelling and degradation by solvents under long-term operations, thus restricting its application for CO2 removal in membrane contacting processes. Therefore, developing novel membranes to improve the durability in the GLMC process is of significant importance. 
To achieve this goal, an inorganic-organic fluorinated titania-silica (fTiO2-SiO2)/PVDF composite membrane was fabricated via facile in-situ vapor-induced hydrolyzation method followed by hydrophobic modification. This low mass-transfer-resistance membrane, composing of a mesoporous layer deposited onto macroporous substrate, was designed for biogas upgrading in GLMC application. Surface hydroxylation was introduced to facilitate the bridging of TiO2-SiO2 nanoparticles and PVDF substrate, which resulted in a more coherent deposition of fTiO2-SiO2 layer onto the substrate. The surface microstructure was fine-tuned by controlling the amount of doped Si precursor, forming an integrated mesoporous fTiO2-SiO2 layer. The resultant fTiO2-SiO2/PVDF composite hollow fiber membrane exhibited a tighter pore size of {\textasciitilde}25 nm and a desired water contact angle of {\textasciitilde}124°, which effectively prevented membrane wetting. The high CO2 absorption fluxes were achieved due to lower mass transfer resistance, by using 1 M of monoethanolamine (MEA) and sodium taurinate as absorbents, respectively. The long-term stability test showed a good integrity between the fTiO2-SiO2 layer and the PVDF substrate after 31 days of GLMC operation. The main benefit is the robust fluorinated inorganic layer that exhibited strong chemical resistance and high hydrophobicity, thus preventing membrane damage and pore wetting. This study provides an insight into the preparation of high-performance inorganic/organic composite hollow fiber membranes for CO2 removal in GLMC applications. 
Considering the high corrosion and energy-intensity of using traditional amine-based absorbents for CO2 capture in GLMC processes, it is more appropriate to use environmentally-benign solvents for CO2 capture. A highly efficient biocatalytic carbonic anhydrase (CA)-polydopamine (PDA)/polyethylenimine (PEI)-PVDF composite membrane was designed and fabricated for CO2 conversion and capture using water as absorbent. The co-deposition of PDA/PEI with amino functional groups was employed to amine-functionalize a PVDF substrate as support for subsequent in-situ CA immobilization by cross-linking with glutaraldehyde. This enhances the enzyme stability and prolongs its lifespan, thus facilitating CO2 removal efficiency in the GLMC process due to the superb catalysis of CA enzyme for CO2 hydration. By using water as absorbent with a liquid velocity of 0.25 m·s−1 in a bench-scale GLMC setup, a high-efficiency CO2 absorption flux (2.5 × 10−3 mol·m−2·s−1) of the proposed biocatalytic membrane was obtained, which was {\textasciitilde}165\% higher than that of the non-biocatalytic membrane. A good long-term stability in terms of enzyme activity for CO2 hydration of the biocatalytic composite membranes was also achieved during 40 days of test duration. Overall, the results achieved in this work could provide promising insights into the development of biocatalytic membranes for extended GLMC applications using environmentally-benign absorbents to achieve a high-efficiency CO2 removal. 
Inspired by better gas selectivity along with tunable pore size and facile functionalization of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), a highly efficient aminosilane-modified zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (mZIF-8) based composite hollow fiber membrane with a dense skin layer was successfully fabricated for biogas upgrading in the GLMC process by dispersing mZIF-8 into dense polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrix and depositing on a porous PVDF substrate. (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane was introduced to modify the ZIF-8 nanocrystals in order to cross-link with PDMS chains for further hydrophobicity enhancement. Compared with the pristine PVDF membrane, the newly developed composite membranes with a dense skin exhibited competitive hydrophobicity with a contact angle of 130°, ensuring its anti-wetting ability. The mZIF-8 based composite membrane realized a higher CO2 mass transfer efficiency as well as a higher selectivity of CO2/CH4 using water or aqueous amine absorbents in GLMC processes. A robust long-term stability of mZIF-8 based composite membrane was also achieved in a 15-day operation. This work provides a new strategy to improve the biogas upgrading performance using dense composite membranes with modified MOFs in GLMC applications.},

	title = {The potential of carbon nanomaterials for advancing high-performance membranes},
	url = {https://dr.ntu.edu.sg//handle/10356/68841},
	abstract = {Carbon nanomaterials (CNMs) are potential materials to be used as diffusion barriers for membrane-based separations. In particular, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene-based materials, such as graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets, have displayed exceptional water transport properties and excellent molecular sieving capabilities owing to their unique structures and physicochemical properties. Presently, state-of-the art CNM-based membranes exhibited extraordinary membrane performances but are challenging to fabricate. Mixed-matrix CNM-based membranes, on the other hand, are easier to fabricate. However, it is difficult to fully exploit the remarkable properties when CNMs are encapsulated. Therefore, the emphasis in this work is strategically focused on the fabrication of surface-modified CNM-based membranes in order to strike a balance between the two. The objective is to investigate the potential of CNMs as diffusion barriers with the purpose of advancing membrane performances to alleviate the global water scarcity challenge.
 This study began with the demonstration of freestanding GO and rGO core barriers in sandwich-architectured poly(lactic acid) (PLA)-graphene composite membranes. Micrometers-thick freestanding GO and rGO barriers exhibited high barrier properties towards oxygen and water vapor molecules. In particular, PLA-rGO showed a significant 87.6\% decline in water vapor permeability with a reduction in oxygen permeability by two orders of magnitude. Mechanistic analysis attributed this to the extensive and tortuous diffusion pathway which can be up to 1450 times the thickness of the rGO barrier. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of graphene-based materials, the GO deposition on the surface of a hollow fiber substrate was engineered to only nanometers-thick. At this thickness, the GO deposition was found to serve as an effective selective barrier and achieved 86\% higher water permeability without sacrificing on membrane selectivity when used to substitute a part of the hollow fiber selective layer. The relatively lower hydrodynamic resistance of the GO sheets and their two-dimensional structures, which essentially fine-tuned the pore size distribution of the nanofiltration (NF) membrane, constituted the GO sheets as effective selective barriers. Next, functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were explored as effective water nanochannels in the hollow fiber selective layer. The water permeability of the membrane was enhanced up to 44\% in the NF process with inconsequential impact on the membrane selectivity. Correspondingly, the water flux was increased up to 29\% in the active layer-facing-feed water orientation without compromising on the reverse salt flux when using 0.5 M MgCl2 as the draw solution in the forward osmosis process. These empirical findings inspired the amalgamation of both MWCNTs and rGO sheets to give all-carbon nanoarchitectures. The nanoachitectures utilized rGO as effective selective barriers and MWCNTs as water nanochannels to achieve a water permeability of 52.7 L m-2 h-1 bar-1 and an almost 100\% rejection rates towards methylene blue, acid orange 7 and rhodamine B solutes. Most importantly, the all-carbon nanoarchitectures demonstrated outstanding membrane stability towards turbulent hydrodynamic flow conditions up to 2000 mL/min cross-flow rate. Physicochemical characterization revealed that the inner graphitic walls of the MWCNTs can serve as anchors for the nanoscale rGO foliates on the outer walls of the MWCNTs to interconnect with the assimilated rGO sheets via van der Waals attractions and pi-pi stacking interactions.
In conclusion, this thesis presents a detailed study using graphene-based materials and MWCNTs as selective diffusion barriers on the membrane surfaces for NF and FO processes. The results suggested that the exceptional water transport properties of the CNMs can indeed be translated onto the membrane surfaces to enhance membrane performances under practical membrane hydrodynamic operations. Fundamentally, this work contributes towards the development of surface-modified CNM-based membrane and facilitates the realization of practical, high-performance separations using CNM-based membranes.},

	abstract = {Forward osmosis (FO) is a membrane process that occurs when solutions of different osmotic pressures are separated by a membrane which is selectively permeable to water. It is a process that drives water permeation across the membrane spontaneously even in the absence of hydraulic pressure difference across the membrane. FO has attracted lots of attention over the last decade and has been explored as a potential alternative to desalination, wastewater treatment and liquid food processing. Significant progress has been made in the development of high-performance FO membranes with high water flux and low reverse solute flux, particularly cellulosic membranes, thin-film composite (TFC) membranes and polyelectrolyte-based membranes. Yet, a few major challenges continue to hamper the widespread implementation of the process in the industry, mainly internal concentration polarization, reverse solute diffusion, membrane fouling, mechanical durability and draw solution regeneration. Most of these challenges are associated with membrane characteristics, which has significantly limited the efficiency of the FO process. 
To address these challenges, firstly, hollow fiber ultrafiltration membranes were fabricated from polyethersulfone (PES) via a non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) process and were used as substrates to prepare inner-selective TFC hollow fiber membranes via an interfacial polymerization (IP) process. The effect of the hollow fiber substrate fabrication conditions on the properties of the substrate and TFC membranes were briefly investigated. The FO performance of the TFC membranes were characterized by using 0.5 M NaCl and DI water as the draw and feed solutions. when the membrane was operated in the active layer-facing-feed solution (AL-FS) and active layer-facing-draw solution (AL-DS) configurations, water flux as high as 41.2 L/m2/h and 74.9 L/m2/h were achieved, while specific reverse solute flux were 0.11 g/L and 0.10 g/L, respectively.
Subsequently, a novel double-skinned hollow fiber TFC FO membrane has been successfully fabricated. The FO membrane consisted of a one-step dual-layer substrate and a thin inner selective layer formed via the IP process. The substrate comprises a dense ultrafiltration (UF) outer layer and a relatively porous UF inner layer, both of which were constructed from PES by using a dual-layer co-extrusion technique. The fouling resistance of the double-skinned hollow fiber membrane was evaluated under various testing conditions to verify the viability of double-skinned hollow fiber membranes as a solution to membrane fouling in the FO process. Compared to the commercial and reported double-skinned FO membranes, the FO membrane developed in this thesis exhibited a higher permeate flux with humic acid solution as a feed solution. Furthermore, the double-skinned FO membrane was applied in concentrating activated sludge using 0.5 M NaCl as a draw solution. A permeate flux at 5.4 L/m2/h was achieved after 5-hour operation, which was higher than, or comparable to, those of the reported FO membranes. Membrane autopsies and foulant analysis suggested that the dense UF skin layer helped to reject larger-sized organic foulants ({\textgreater} 300 Da), which shed light on the importance of fabrication features and promising application of the double-skinned hollow fiber TFC FO membrane in sludge concentration.
On the other hand, a series of characterization revealed that TFC hollow fiber membranes may experience significant compaction during the FO process despite the lack of applied pressure. Three TFC hollow fiber membranes were fabricated with varied water permeability to study the effect of the osmotic pressure on the TFC membranes. The TFC membranes were continuously tested in FO experiments for 24 h using DI water as feed and varied concentration of NaCl solutions as draw solutions, and their performances were evaluated again using fresh feed solutions. At the end of the FO experiments, all TFC membranes experienced water and salt flux decline to different extents. Visible changes in the cross-sectional morphology and surface topography of the TFC membranes were observed. These observations suggested that the occurrence of membrane compaction is strongly associated with the characteristics of the hollow fiber substrates that were used to prepare the TFC membranes and may be attributed to “negative pressure” build-up within the support layer of the TFC membranes.},

	abstract = {The inevitable membrane fouling during membrane filtration processes hinder the further application of membrane technology. Developing techniques for effectively mitigating membrane fouling relies on an in-depth understanding of the fouling mechanisms. This study proposes a two-dimensional network-based approach where the membrane was discretized and the fate of each particle was monitored individually, to explore the underlying external fouling mechanisms during dead-end microfiltration using polycarbonate track-etched membrane with cylindrical uniform pores. Three fouling parameters, namely the probabilistic factor for deposition in the non-porous area (β), the initial cake resistance (Rc0), and the specific cake resistance with respect to cake thickness (Rc’), can be obtained to characterize the fouling behavior by best-fitting the experimental flux-decline data to the network model. In parallel to theoretical study, advanced membrane fouling characterization technology, namely three-dimensional optical coherence tomography (OCT) scanning also applied to investigate fouling mechanisms. Online non-invasive OCT technique was applied to characterize the BSA protein fouling development on three different kinds of membranes with similar vendor-given pore size and porosity and a layer-based OCT image analysis method was established. The results showed that OCT is able to successfully reveal the external and internal fouling, however the implementation of quantitative comparison of protein internal fouling among the membranes was impossible from OCT results. The coupling of the network model and OCT characterization was employed to investigate the effect of the surface charged of monodisperse particulate foulants on cake formation and the fouling cake evolution of bidisperse suspensions in dead-end microfiltration. The results showed for the negatively charged polycarbonate track-etched membrane, negatively charged latex tended to deposit on the pore and form cluster due to repulsive particle-membrane electrostatic interactions. The bidisperse feeds with low mass ration of large particles tended to form homogeneous cake but the presence of a higher concentration of large particles lead to heterogeneous cakes; the presence of a lower concentration of large particles enhanced clustering while a higher concentration reduced that.},

	abstract = {In this study, a novel nanofiltration membrane bioreactor (NF-MBR) was developed and integrated
with the reverse osmosis (RO) process for water reclamation. The underlying motivation of using
NF-MBR as a pre-treatment to the RO process is to improve the RO feed quality and subsequently
increase the RO recovery ratio. The use of a glutaraldehyde (GA) crosslinked layer-by-layer
polyelectrolyte low-pressure hollow fiber NF membrane has overcome the inherent issues of low
permeate flux and membrane stability in the NF-MBR system. Higher organic removal was
observed in the NF-MBR than the ultrafiltration MBR (UF-MBR) due to the extended retention
time that allows the enhanced biodegradation of the retained organics in the bioreactor. In the NFMBR system applied in this study, the negative impact arisen from the salt accumulation was
alleviated by allowing the passage of monovalent ions, particularly NaCl. The build-up of salts
(i.e., Ca, Mg, PO4) is a function of SRT, hydraulic retention time (HRT) and membrane rejection.
Despite the accumulation of salts, the NF-MBRs achieved excellent biodegradation efficiency,
organic removal ({\textgreater}97\%) and ammonia removal ({\textgreater}98\%). The improved MBR permeate quality has
led to {\textasciitilde}3.7 times decrease in the RO fouling rates as compared to the UF-MBR+RO process.
Further analysis indicated that the cake layer fouling that caused the cake-enhanced osmotic
pressure (CEOP) effect contributed predominantly to the transmembrane pressure (TMP) increase
in the NF-MBR. Our study substantiated that the NF-MBR+RO system is a feasible option for
high recovery water reclamation by comparing the energy requirement for the NF-MBR+RO and
UF-MBR+RO system.},

	abstract = {Seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) desalination technology is an important technology for providing potable water for industries and human daily life due to its lower-energy consumption compared to thermal based desalination technology. However, membrane fouling is still a persistent problem in SWRO desalination plants. Organic fouling and biofouling, in particular the interplay between them, are the challenges that require attention.

In the first part of my study, the focus was on organic fouling in SWRO desalination process. Classifying organics in seawater will provide an in-depth understanding of the important fraction on SWRO organic fouling. The dissolved organic matter (DOM) in seawater was fractionated and concentrated by a membrane-based technique into three major fractions according to their molecular weight (MW) as defined in the liquid chromatography with organic carbon detection (LC-OCD) method, namely the fraction of biopolymer (F.BP, MW {\textgreater} 1000 Da), fraction of humic substance with building block (F.HS\&BB, MW 350 – 1000 Da), and fraction of low molecular weight compounds (F.LMW, MW {\textless} 350 Da). An overall recovery of {\textgreater}80\% of the organics in seawater was attained. Compared with model foulants such as sodium alginate (SA), bovine serum albumin (BSA), and humic acid (HA), all isolated organic fractions showed lower fluorescence intensities, and had lower fouling potentials than common model foulants used in SWRO fouling studies, thus the model foulants were not good representatives of the natural organics in seawater. In addition, results from atomic force microscopy (AFM) and extended Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (XDLVO) theory showed that initial fouling (i.e., foulant-membrane interaction) was the main driver in SWRO organic fouling with F.BP as the major contributor followed by F.LMW. In addition, divalent ions were found to enhance the RO fouling by increasing the adhesion and cohesion forces between foulant-membrane and foulant-foulant.

In second part of my study, the focus was on biofouling and the interplay between organic fouling and biofouling in SWRO desalination process by using the isolated dissolved organic fractions. From the assimilable organic carbon (AOC) results, the AOC/DOC ratio was in the order of F.LMW ({\textasciitilde}35\%) {\textgreater} F.BP ({\textasciitilde}19\%) {\textgreater} F.HS\&BB ({\textasciitilde}8\%); AOC/DOC of seawater was {\textasciitilde}20\%; organic compositions of seawater were BP {\textasciitilde}6\%, HS\&BB {\textasciitilde}52\% and LMW {\textasciitilde}42\%; thus LMW accounted for {\textgreater}70\% of AOC in seawater. Their impact on SWRO biofouling in term of flux decline rate was in the order of F.LMW ({\textasciitilde}30\%) {\textgreater} F.BP ({\textasciitilde}20\%) {\textgreater} F.HS\&BB ({\textless}10\%). Despite being the major organic compound in seawater, HS\&BB showed marginal effect on biofouling. The role of indigenous BP was less critical owing to its relatively low concentration. LMW, which was the major AOC contributor, played a significant role in biofouling by promoting microbial growth that contributed to the build-up of soluble microbial products and exopolymeric substances (i.e., in particular BP). Therefore, seawater pretreatment shall focus on the removal of AOC (i.e., LMW) rather than the removal of biopolymer. 

In third part of my study, the focus was on the LMW removal by using low-pressure NF pretreatment process and the subsequent impact on SWRO fouling. Three different membranes were evaluated: NF270 was a commercial membrane based on polyamide thin film composite with negatively charged surface, NF1 and NF2 were glutaraldehyde cross-linked layer-by-layer polyelectrolyte membranes with positively charged surface (i.e., NF2 contained more polyelectrolyte layers than NF1). The organic/inorganic rejection of NF membranes followed the order of NF2 {\textgreater} NF1 {\textgreater} NF270 while pure water permeability (PWP) was in the order of NF1 {\textgreater} NF270 {\textgreater} NF2. Meanwhile the degree of RO fouling in term of flux decline and foulant amount was in the order of NF270 {\textgreater} NF1 {\textgreater} NF2. In addition, the results suggested that NF membrane can be optimized to achieve excellent removal of LMW, but a balance between permeability, rejection and fouling shall be considered when selecting the membrane for seawater pretreatment. For instance, NF2 membrane with the lowest permeability ({\textasciitilde}1.9 LMH/bar) was less competitive even though it showed the lowest SWRO fouling (i.e., flux decline {\textasciitilde}3\%) as compared to NF 1 (permeability of 4.0 LMH/bar, flux decline {\textasciitilde}10\%).},

	title = {Fabrication of novel nanocomposite membranes and {3D} printed spacers for forward osmosis process},
	url = {https://dr.ntu.edu.sg//handle/10356/69233},
	abstract = {Forward osmosis (FO) is a novel osmotic-driven membrane process with lower energy consumption and many potential applications. However, the water flux of FO membranes was severely affected by concentration polarization (CP) of solutes on both the FO membrane surface and inside the FO membrane substrate. To address the CP issues in FO process, two strategies have been successfully developed. First, silica gel (SG)-based mixed matrix FO membranes have been systematically synthesized and characterized for the first time. The incorporation of SG particles into the polyacrylonitrile (PAN) support layer significantly enhanced water permeability of SG-based mixed matrix FO membranes. Water permeability of these membranes were improved after the embedment of SG particles with the range of 0.25 – 1.0 wt.\% SG loading, possibly as a result of the both porous nature of SG particles and the enhanced membrane substrate porosity. However, further increasing in SG loading to 2.0 wt.\%, a marginal reduction in both water permeability and salt rejection was observed, most likely due to the agglomeration of SG and hence reduce the mass transfer inside the membrane substrate. The optimal SG-based mixed matrix FO membrane with 1.0 wt.\% SG loading had a significantly higher water permeability compared to the neat PAN membrane without embedment of any SG particles. This membrane can achieve the highest FO water fluxes of {\textgreater} 100 L/m2 h by using the 1 M MgCl2 as the draw solution (DS) and DI water as the feed solution (FS). 

Second, the effect of SG particles with different pore size on SG-based mixed matrix FO membranes was investigated. The objective of this study is to improve the mass transfer in the porous FO substrates and hence improving the internal concentration polarization (ICP) using the mixed matrix strategy. SG-based mixed matrix FO membranes with different pore size were successfully fabricated via non-solvent incudes phase inversion (NIPS) by adding silica gel particles with different pore size into the polyacrylonitrile dope solution. The thin salt rejection layer was synthesized using a layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly method on top of the SG-based mixed matrix FO substrate. The current study demonstrates the effect of different pore size of SG particle in mixed matrix FO substrate for improving the ICP in FO application for the first time.

Third, the use of environmental-friendly metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as green template was proven to enhance porosity and interconnectivity of the water treatment membranes. In general, osmotic-driven membranes with high porosity can possibly be fabricated by removing MOFs template, such as low water stability or other nanoparticles, in polymeric matrix. It is important to note that greatly enhanced water permeability was observed, which might be ascribed to the increased mass transfer coefficient of the FO substrate layer, which can be considered as an ultrafiltration (UF) membrane. 

Fourth, the use of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as removable filler was explored to prepare MOF-based porous matrix membranes (PMMs) for improving the mass transfer in the FO substrates and hence controlling the ICP. MOF-based porous matrix substrates (PMSs) with three different types of MOFs were prepared via phase inversion by adding MOF particles into the polyacrylonitrile (PAN) dope solution. The bond dissociation energy (BDE) between metal ions and organic linker of MOF particles played an important role for the selection of fillers of PMMs. For MOF particles with lower BDE ({\textless} {\textasciitilde}200 kJ/mol), the corresponding MOF-based porous matrix FO membranes had higher membrane bulk porosity. This study shows the effect of different types of MOF particles in MOF-based porous matrix FO substrate for controlling the ICP in FO application for the first time, which provides an additional dimension for ICP control in osmotic-driven membrane processes. 

Finally, 3D printing is an emerging technology and has attracted massive attention in recent years. This part of thesis focuses on the recent developments on enhancing the spacer design with 3D printing technology. With the recent advancement of 3D printing technology, breakthroughs in fabricating novel FO feed spacers are expected in the near future. Improvement of 3D printing technologies in terms of resolution, materials and speed should assure the production of various 3D printed feed spacers with high efficiency and better performance.},

	title = {{3D} printing of feed channel spacers for spiral wound membrane modules},
	url = {https://dr.ntu.edu.sg//handle/10356/75017},
	abstract = {Research in the field of 3D printing and water industry, in particular, on the fabrication and evaluation of feed spacers produced via 3D printing, rapid prototyping or additive manufacturing (AM) techniques is presented in this thesis. Feed spacer is a mesh-like structure placed between membrane sheets to create channels for fluid flow in a spiral wound membrane module (SWM). It has an important role in the hydrodynamic conditions of a SWM, which serves to facilitate mass transfer in the feed channel by generating vortex and promoting mixing. The mass transfer is critical in reducing the concentration polarisation phenomenon in membrane processes, which is often associated with membrane fouling. However, the challenges of commercial feed spacers include the trade-off between mass transfer and pressure drop along the channel that leads to the rise in energy demand as well as their impact on membrane fouling. Many studies via computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations have shown that spacers with complex structures have great potential in enhancing the mass transfer. However, conventional method of spacer manufacturing by extrusion could not realise the complicated designs of spacers. In this work, the 3D printing technology is employed as a tool to fabricate novel feed spacers with structures that maximise the mass transfer while minimise the channel pressure drop. 
It is nevertheless important to note that there are limitations in current AM technology. A link between the design and fabrication i.e. printability and surface finish properties of spacers was established. The printability of polypropylene (PP) which is the representative material of spacers was also investigated. The fabricated spacers were evaluated in terms of flux and pressure drop. Direct observation through the membrane (DOTM) technique was also used to study the impact of different 3D printed spacers on the critical flux of particles. Among the 3 broad classes of solid, liquid, powder based 3D printing techniques, the liquid based Polyjet technique was found to give the most accurate representation of the intended design while the solid based FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) technique produced spacers that showed the greatest deviation from the specifications. On the other hand, the improvement in mass transfer by the FDM printed spacer was unexpectedly the greatest among the three 3D printed spacers, due to the ‘randomness’ in the strand of spacer. In addition, the surface finish of the spacers was found to have an effect on the critical flux, specifically, the anisotropic surface finish of FDM and semi-anisotropic surface finish of Polyjet. Biofouling potential was discovered to be correlated to the surface roughness of samples. Among which, Polyjet and SLS printed samples have greater bacteria attachment due to their higher microscale roughness. Eventually, three design considerations for developing 3D printed novel spacers were recommended. 
A series of existing (i.e., taken from the literatures), modified and innovative spacer structures, compared with commercial feed spacer, were examined to identify the basis form of spacer structure with the greatest potential. Further optimization of the selected structure was conducted to improve the spacer performance. With the  primary structure made up of sinusoidal curves and secondary structures  consisting cylindrical protrusions along the curve, the novel spacer S12 showed an improvement of 18\% at power number, Pn=106, and 25\% at Pn= 105 in mass transfer compared to commercial spacer. With this optimal design, a smart multi-material spacer was developed by designing the primary structure with a rigid material and the secondary structures with flexible materials. The multi-material responsive spacer with Tangoblackplus as the flexible material was able to lower the flux decline due to bentonite fouling by 7.6\% as compared to the commercial spacer and 5.2\% when compared to the single rigid material spacer. This indicates that a spacer with flexible filaments has a beneficial effect on fouling reduction. The flexible properties of the selected section on the spacer allow dynamic movement under varying flow rate, which creates a “sweeping” effect that disrupts the boundary layers and prevents foulants from accumulating near spacer filaments and on the membrane surface, thereby mitigating fouling. These favourable findings have contributed as one of the pioneering work in this interdisciplinary field.},

	abstract = {The intensive use of antibiotics for human, veterinary and agricultural purposes results in their continuous release into the environment, which causes the concern in relation to the development of antibiotic resistance genes and bacteria. Sulfate radical based advanced oxidation processes (SR-AOPs) have been recognized as an effective alternative method to the destruction of recalcitrant organics in wastewater, in which highly-reactive sulfate radical was generated and utilized to oxidize organic contaminants to innocuous CO2 and H2O. However, most of the catalysts used in SR-AOPs are suspended in water during usage and therefore need a further separation process. On the other hand, membrane separation has been proved to be a promising technology for water purification in recent decades because of the high yield of production and low energy consumption. However, the membrane fouling caused by the accumulation of a broad range of foulants on top of membrane surface / inside the membrane pores results in a substantial decrease in their water permeability, which leads to a high permeability loss and energy consumption. Meanwhile, the separation principle for microfiltration (MF) is based on size exclusion, which means that it cannot remove many kinds of organic micro-pollutants during the physical separation process, resulting in the effluent discharge with potential hazard. The aim of this thesis work is to overcome these drawbacks by integrating MF with SR-AOPs in the water purification system to remove antibiotics, in which sulfamethoxazole (SMX) works as the target pollutant. 
Firstly, a Co3O4 surface functionalized ceramic membrane (CoFCM) was synthesized via a novel ZIF-67 induced surface nucleated heterogeneous growth method (Chapter 3). The CoFCM showed an enhanced performance in SMX removal in a semi-batch experiment. In chapter 4, a Co3O4 impregnated ceramic membrane (CoCM) was developed via an in-situ self-scarified template method. With this method, Co3O4 was isotropically impregnated into the whole membrane while did not affect the pore size of the membranes. Due to the advantages of mix-metal oxides on PMS activation, a cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4) impregnated ceramic membrane was developed via a one-step urea combustion method (Chapter 5). Results showed that CoFe2O4 was impregnated into the membrane pores as well as the membrane surface. With increasing of repeating times, the catalyst loading amount increased while the pure water permeability decreased, which means the catalyst would form a dense catalytic layer on the membrane surface due to the aggregation during the combustion process. The membrane performance was evaluated in a home-made dead-end membrane filtration mode, and results showed the robust membrane can function well during a wide pH range as well as the existence of NOM and anions.
Finally, to have a better understanding on the SMX transformation via PMS in the presence of nano-bimetallic Co/Fe oxides, a systematic study was conducted in Chapter 6. The influencing factors (pH, NOM, catalyst loading and PMS dosage) were investigated and the radical generation as well as PMS activation mechanism were explored. The SMX transformation pathway including both non-radical and radical pathways was proposed.},

	title = {Development of novel monitors for early detection of fouling in reverse osmosis systems},
	url = {https://dr.ntu.edu.sg//handle/10356/61675},
	abstract = {Today, the leading technology for new desalination installations uses reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. The current generation of RO membranes is of sufficiently high permeability that further significant improvement in RO membrane permeability is less likely to be the primary driver for a major reduction in the cost of desalination but should arise from a variety of other process improvements. As the primary energy use in an RO system is the power required for the high pressure to pump the feed water and is directly related to the feed pressure and flow rate, savings can come in the energy costs in pre‐empting fouling problems. In this project, a novel sensor has been developed to provide more reliable information for process monitoring based on a side-stream RO fouling monitor cell simulating flows in the plant termed the ‘canary cell’. The canary cell is found to be representative of the spiral wound module (SWM), which is the most commonly used configuration in the water desalination industry that can serve as an early warning system. Using a non‐invasive method of Ultrasonic Time Domain Reflectometry (UTDR), foulants on the RO membrane can be detected. The UTDR sensor applies an acoustic signal that reflects from interfaces such as membrane and fouling layer in the cell. The method can detect changes in properties over a few microns and are well suited for integration with the ‘canary cell’ to detect incipient fouling. The UTDR sensor has been shown to monitor colloidal fouling in-situ, in real-time and non-destructively that provides evidence for the metastability of colloidal fouling. Various operational parameters are further evaluated to understand and potentially control the onset of metastability. With the usage of acoustic enhancers, the UTDR sensor was further adapted for the detection of the biofouling, which would otherwise be incapable of reflecting the ultrasound wave for detection due to insufficient difference in acoustic impedance since the bulk of biofilms are water medium. The combination with another online sensor, the Feed Fouling Monitor (FFM), further expanded the application of the UTDR sensor to predicting RO fouling through the measurements of foulant thickness and mass-based specific cake resistance. FFM is an adaptation of the Integrity Sensor (IS) that operates by measuring the transmembrane pressure (TMP) across a membrane of a low hydraulic resistance relative to a reference pressure differential.},

	abstract = {Providing potable water to the affected population (AP) is one of the first priorities after a disaster. However, the process in providing potable water to the AP is often constrained by the absence of an adequate power supply and limited means of transportation. As such, compact and easily-deployable emergency water technologies with simple and relatively low-energy operation are desirable. The aim of this research was to develop a novel infrastructure-independent approach for point-of-use water treatment through the fabrication of cryogels. Macroporous cryogels, which are formed by conducting a polymerization reaction in a semifrozen system in which the ice crystals (for aqueous systems) act as the porogens, display exceptional mechanical and swelling properties. These cryogels were further functionalized with silver nanoparticles to impart antimicrobial properties. Inspired by the remarkable mechanical and swelling-deswelling properties of  cryogels, a novel approach was proposed in which the cryogels can be used as a sorbent to treat water. The method developed in this research offers the simplicity of allowing the cryogel to swell in contaminated water after which the treated water can be recovered by a simple squeezing step. By using the proposed approach, the cryogels are envisioned to remove particulates via size exclusion, and inactivate bacteria through the action of AgNPs.},

	shorttitle = {Submerged hollow fibre membrane fouling},
	url = {https://dr.ntu.edu.sg//handle/10356/55771},
	abstract = {The filtration behavior and energy consumption of submerged hollow fibre membranes has been investigated in a dead end mode under constant flux operation with periodic backwash. Various operating parameters such as filtration flux, feed concentration, backwash duration, backwash strength, and the aid of air scouring during backwash were investigated to optimize the filtration performance and energy consumption. The results showed that filtration flux and feed concentration have significant effects on membrane fouling rate. In order to maximize the net permeate volume, filtration flux, backwash duration and backwash strength were found to be the most important parameters, which must be carefully selected. To minimize the specific energy consumption, filtration flux, backwash duration and aeration rate during backwash were the most important factors.
Experimental results in this study show that the effectiveness of fixed backwash cycles can decrease over time and reach a point at which the backwash effectiveness suddenly decreases. Evidence from transmembrane pressure (TMP) monitoring suggests that the sudden decrease in backwash efficiency occurs when the pressure on the permeate side of the membrane at the end of a backwash cycle does not reach the atmospheric pressure maintained on the feed side. The release of dissolved air on the permeate side of the membrane due to the pressure drop across the membrane was recognized as a major reason for reducing the backwash effectiveness. A mathematical model has been developed to calculate the minimum backwash duration required to reverse the flow through the membrane by increasing the permeate-side pressure up to atmospheric pressure. The minimum required backwash duration depends on the pressure at the beginning of the backwash, backwash flowrate, the amount of air on the permeate side, membrane surface area, water viscosity, temperature, and the membrane and fouling resistance. 
Adaptation of evapoporometry (EP) for characterization of hollow fibres involving development of the analysis method and also designing and applying a suitable test cell and protocol has been completed. Evapoporometry was used to characterize two different types of UF hollow fibre membrane (PVDF \& PAN). The results indicated that evapoporometry was able to adequately characterize pore-size distribution of clean and fouled hollow fibre membranes. The benefits of EP have been highlighted.
The changes in pore size distribution (PSD) of UF hollow fibre membranes due to residual fouling and periodical backwashing of the fibres were investigated. PSD analysis showed that the larger pores were more prone to pore blocking than small pores. However, backwashing was more effective in restoring these larger pores. Flow distribution analysis showed that the largest pores played an important role in membrane permeability. However, high pressure backwashing was found to enlarge the membrane pores in an irreversible way. The implications of this for membrane fouling characterization have been discussed.},

	abstract = {Membrane filtration systems are successful methods to make high-quality water. An important issue and most challenging problem regarding these systems is fouling which arises from particle deposition in and on the membrane surface. Membrane fouling reduces performance of membranes and increases operational costs. Due to this problem, a reliable index to predict the fouling potential of feed water is important in preventing and characterizing membrane fouling and for monitoring the performance of pre-treatment during plant operation. The conventional fouling indices such, as SDI and MFI, are usually determined via off-line measurement techniques based on dead-end filtration, which does not consider the actual flow conditions. To have a better understanding of the conventional fouling indices, the effect of several parameters on SDI, MFI, MFI-UF (constant pressure and constant flux) were investigated. In contrast with MFI, the SDI results confirmed the non-linear response to foulants concentration. The specific cake resistance for colloidal silica and humic acid was found to be maximum at low concentrations and gradually declined at higher concentrations. It was also highlighted that fouling by mixed foulants cannot be related simply to the individual MFIs. The effect of salt concentration on MFI-UF (constant pressure and constant flux) was also investigated over a broad range of NaCl (0 to 25,000 mg/L) for colloidal silica and humic acid. The results indicated that MFI-UFconst.pressure of the colloidal silica passed through a maximum (under constant pressure filtration) while for humic acid MFI-UFconst.pressure increased monotonically. To overcome the limitations of these techniques, an on-line flow simulator, the feed fouling monitor (FFM), has been developed for characterization of the fouling propensity of feed water to RO. The FFM is based on the principle of particle deposition and cake layer formation on a small ‘collection’ membrane in the device under cross flow conditions, which can be correlated to the particulate fouling (including colloidal particles and macromolecules) encountered in a RO operation. The information obtained from FFM was used to estimate cake resistance in RO in order to predict RO fouling profiles at the same hydrodynamic conditions. However, the predicted RO profiles were found to underestimate the actual RO performance due to ignoring the contribution of the cake-enhanced osmotic pressure (CEOP) effect. The model was extended to include the contribution of CEOP and ultrasonic time domain reflectometry (UTDR) was used to monitor the rate of cake thickness increase in RO in order to estimate the cake-enhanced osmotic pressure (CEOP). The cake resistance (obtained from FFM) combined with CEOP could more accurately predict the RO fouling profiles using colloidal silica as a foulant model. A salt tracer response technique (STRT) was also used to measure directly concentration polarization trends and estimate the contribution of CEOP under constant flux using both organic and inorganic foulant models. The predicted RO fouling profiles obtained from combination of FFM and STRT provided a good estimation of the transmembrane pressure (TMP) rise during RO fouling for both humic acid and colloidal silica. The contribution of CEOP to TMP rise was typically greater than the cake resistance.},

	title = {Microporous materials with tailored structural properties for enhanced gas separation},
	url = {https://dr.ntu.edu.sg//handle/10356/90277},
	abstract = {Extensive research on the gas separation process has been conducted in view of the current industrial gas separation processes which uses cryogenic distillation and liquefaction are energy-intensive. In this regard, adsorbents and membranes which demonstrate favourable interaction with the desired gases were selected in view of their capability in performing effective separation at a lower energy penalty together with smaller plant footprint. Hence, the main objective of this thesis is to investigate and develop novel nanoporous materials and membranes that are capable in providing effective separation and capture of desired gas components.
The study begins with the development of hierarchical zeolite MFI for its feasibility in SF6 adsorption. Clear enhancement in overall SF6 adsorption kinetics was observed with the creation of hierarchical structure, thus indicating its usefulness in rapid SF6 adsorption-desorption cycling. Under similar strategy, hierarchical HKUST-1 and PPN were developed for its potential in SF6 capture and recovery. HKUST-1 possess open metal sites allows reversible interaction with SF6. Therefore, hierarchical structures were created to allow an increased accessibility of SF6 to the active sites, as the kinetic diameter of SF6 is larger as compared to CO2. Besides, PPN which demonstrates better resistance towards chemical degradation and humidity was created by the variation of porosity properties. The incorporation of an optimal amount of tertiary amine allows an improvement in SF6/N2 selectivity in both equilibrium and dynamic condition, together with sharp segregation between SF6 and N2 peaks in chromatographic separation. Nonetheless, enhancement in SF6 adsorption kinetics is limited by its large micropore size. Besides, the facilitation the overall adsorption-desorption cycling of adsorbate was verified by the creation hollow-structured nanomaterial. Based on the study conducted, creation of hollow structure (Co-MOF-74hollow nanorods) allows the shaper CO2 breakthrough curve together with sharper chromatographic separation between CO2 and N2.
On the other hand, the investigation of nanoporous materials was further conducted with the utilization as filler in mixed-matrix membrane (MMM). Permeability-selectivity trade-off in polymeric membrane has been well reported as solution-diffusion mechanism is the main transport mechanism of gases in membranes. The incorporation of nanoporous materials into polymeric membrane has been the most technical viable option to improve the gas separation performance. In general, MOFs has attracted vast research interest as the fillers in MMM in view of its large surface area and pore volume, where the functionalities can be tuned via pre- or post-synthetic functionalization. In this work, HKUST-1 nanocrystals were incorporated into polymeric membrane for O2/N2, CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2 separation. It has been observed that the utilization of HKUST-1 nanocrystal as the filler materials has demonstrated an increase in gas (O2, CO2) permeability, without compromising the mixed-gas selectivity. Besides, amine-functionalized HKUST-1 nanocrystals is feasible in improving CO2/N2 selectivity without compromising CO2 permeability.
In conclusion, this thesis presents the development of nanoporous materials and membranes in the field of gas separation. Considering that the potential of nanoporous materials and membranes in other gas separation processes is immense, future work will be generally focussed on the application of nanoporous materials and membranes in terms of the plausible potentials in other separation process (e.g. olefin/paraffin). Besides, other factors that hamper the practicability of nanoporous materials in industrial gas separation process such as the presence of water in the feed will be conducted. It has been observed that the presence of water molecules can compete with the desired test gases, which in general limits the overall gas separation performance.},

	abstract = {In the study of synthesizing LbL FO membranes, the membrane substrate was firstly tailored (high porosity, finger-like pores, thin thickness, and high hydrophilicity) to achieve a small structural parameter of 0.5 mm. Secondly, the polyelectrolyte layers were deposited on the support membrane top surface for a number of times by soaking repeatedly in poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) and poly(sodium 4-styrene-sulfonate) (PSS) in an alternative sequence. Increasing the number of polyelectrolyte layers improved the selectivity of the LbL membranes while reducing their water permeability. The more selective membrane 6\#LbL (with 6 polyelectrolyte layers) had much lower reverse solute transport compared to 3\#LbL and 1\#LbL. The FO water flux was found to be strongly affected by both membrane water permeability and reverse solute transportation. Severe solute reverse transport was observed for the active-layer-facing-draw-solution (AL-DS) membrane orientation, which is likely due to the suppression of Donnan exclusion by the high ionic strength of the draw solution. In contrast, the active-layer-facing-feed-solution (AL-FS) orientation showed remarkable FO performance (15, 20, and 28 L/m2.h at 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 M MgCl2, respectively, for membrane 3\#LbL using distilled water as feed solution).},

	url = {https://dr.ntu.edu.sg//handle/10356/46282},
	abstract = {The performance of nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) membranes can be significantly restricted due to fouling by organic macromolecules during water and wastewater treatment. Fouling causes a reduction of the membrane permeation flux, demands more frequent cleaning, and shortens the membrane life span. Proteins are among the main macromolecules that foul NF and RO membranes. Protein fouling (single, binary mixture and protein-polysaccharide mixture) of NF and RO membranes was systematically investigated in the current work. 

In the study of single protein fouling, the effect of hydrodynamic conditions, feed solution chemistry and membrane properties on fouling by bovine serum albumin (BSA) was evaluated under crossflow conditions over a 4-day fouling period. The initial flux behavior was highly dependent on membrane properties, as membranes with a smoother, more hydrophilic and more charged (favorable electrostatic repulsion with BSA) surface experienced a slower fouling rate. Interestingly, the flux at the end of the 4-day tests (J96hr) showed little dependence on membrane properties, with RO, NF and UF membrane fluxes all converging into a nearly identical value. This suggests that the long-term flux was primarily controlled by the foulant-fouled-membrane surface interaction. Membranes tested at different initial fluxes had a strong tendency to approach a surface-interaction-limited value (limiting flux), although a slightly lower J96hr was observed at higher applied pressures, likely due to foulant layer compaction. BSA fouling was more severe at pH values close to its isoelectric point (IEP), at high ionic strength and in the presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+ as a result of reduced electrostatic repulsion or the promotion of specific ion interactions under these conditions. A linear correlation was observed between J96hr and the square of the zeta potential of BSA, suggesting that this parameter can be potentially a good indicator for predicting the long term fouling behavior.},

	title = {Characterization of mass transfer during membrane filtration processes using novel techniques},
	url = {https://dr.ntu.edu.sg//handle/10356/63293},
	abstract = {Membrane-based separation processes have broad applications in water and wastewater treatment, seawater desalination, food processing, ultrapure water production and energy harvest.  However, the efficiency of both osmotically driven (e.g., forward osmosis, FO) and pressure-driven (e.g., reverse osmosis, RO) filtration processes are adversely affected by the coupled phenomena of concentration polarization (CP) and membrane fouling.  The concentration build-up in the vicinity of the membrane surface is commonly known as the external CP (ECP) that is greatly affected by the fluid hydrodynamics.  On the other hand, the solute accumulation in the porous support layer of the membrane is known as the internal CP (ICP) which is unique in the osmotically driven membrane processes such as FO.  ICP is closely associated with the physical properties of the substrate and is usually characterized by the structural parameter, the S value.  To mitigate the negative influence of CPs and membrane fouling requires in-depth understanding of the mechanisms of mass transfers during filtration processes, which necessitates the development of novel techniques to visualize and quantify the dynamic physico-chemical processes associated with the membrane filtrations.  In this study various novel techniques were exploited to characterize the mass transfers during membrane processes. New experimental protocols were established based on the theoretical models to directly and independently characterize ICP and ECP.  In particular, three methods were proposed in an RO mode to evaluate the S value.   The Jv-method (water flux), the Rs-method (solute rejection) and the Rt-method (trace contaminant rejection) were realized based on the measurements of the RO permeate flux, solute rejection (e.g., NaCl) and trace contaminant rejection (e.g., boron), respectively.  S values determined from the aforementioned methods were compared with that obtained by the conventional FO water flux fitting method.  In particular, the Rs-method was recommended.  By this approach it was able to determine the solute permeability graphically.  It was also feasible to resolve the effect of ECP from that of ICP interpretively using the Rs-method. To investigate the subtle interplay between various membrane substrate structures and ICP, an electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) system was modified to accommodate the FO processes.  The effect of various support structures on CPs was systematically investigated.  In particular, three commercial FO membranes with distinct substrate structures were characterized by an EIS incorporated FO system and the impedance spectra were analyzed based on their equivalent circuits.  Both static (without osmosis) and dynamic (with osmosis) tests were implemented.  In the static tests the limit behaviors of the impedance spectra were employed to resolve the FO membrane structural information from the electrolyte background which was further compared with the scanning electron microscopic micrographs.  The dynamic tests under both membrane orientations were conducted to verify the feasibility of using the EIS technique to capture the variation of the developed concentration profiles within the FO substructures. Furthermore, to visualize and quantify the dynamic processes during the membrane filtration (i.e., to study the CP by visualizing the fluid hydrodynamics in the proximity to the membrane surface and to investigate membrane fouling by direct observation of foulant deposition and formation), the optical coherence tomography (OCT) technique was exploited.  The Doppler OCT facility incorporated with a cross-flow cell first was employed to characterize the hydrodynamics in a spacer-filled channel.  The velocity profile normal to the membrane surface was successfully visualized which is difficult to characterize using conventional membrane characterization techniques.  Various flow patterns were generated by varying the spacer orientations with respect to the bulk flow direction.  A series of Doppler images was used to reveal the subtle interactions between the fluid and the spacer filaments.  The characterization results obtained thereby were used to interpret the performance variation of an RO process with the same spacer configurations.  The feasibility of using the Doppler OCT technique to characterize the hydrodynamics of the fluid in a spacer-filled channel was validated by the experimental results. The OCT technique was further exploited to visualize and quantify the growth of a foulant layer during a filtration process.  In particular, an OCT system was incorporated with a lab-scale membrane filtration system, and the growth of a fouling layer was observed by using the structural OCT imaging.  Taking advantage of the Doppler effects, the OCT-based characterization also provided the velocity profiles of the fluid fields, which is of great value in analyzing the fouling layer formation. The characterization results clearly reveal for the first time the evolution of the morphology of the cake layer under different micro-hydrodynamic environments.  This study demonstrates that the OCT-based characterization is a powerful tool for investigating the dynamic processes during membrane fouling.},

	abstract = {Among the numerous topics related to membrane separation processes, flux performance study remains as the core and foundation of academic research as well as practical application. The current study focuses on the critical flux phenomena in pressure-driven (microfiltration (MF)) as well as in osmotically-driven membrane processes (forward osmosis (FO)). For the MF system, two MF membranes (pore size of 0.1 µm and 0.2µm, respectively) were applied to filter mixed liquor from conventional activated sludge as well as that from a membrane bioreactor (MBR). The critical flux behavior was studied by “pressure stepping “method and “pressure cycling” method under different test conditions. It was found that critical flux evaluation protocol could significantly affect the critical flux value, e.g., lower values were obtained for longer time interval used for the pressure stepping. For the FO process for microalgae harvesting, the algae species Chlorella Sorokiniana was used in the feedwater in a cross flow mode FO system. The effect of physical parameters (flux level, membrane orientation, and cross flow) on FO fouling and flux behavior during algae separation were investigated. The impact of chemical parameters (feed water chemistry, draw solution chemistry) was explored by adding Mg2+ ions into the feed water and draw solution. The concept of critical flux was applied successfully in FO process. Moreover, a systematic study to investigate the effect of solute back diffusion, a unique phenomenon in FO process, on FO fouling revealed that the critical flux can be drastically reduced as a result of the specific foulant-ion interaction induced by the diffusion of Mg2+ from the draw solution to the feed solution. Depends on the semi-transparency feature of the flat-sheet FO membrane and the good visibility of algae cells through microscope, direct observation method was further applied to monitor algae deposition on FO membranes. Microscopic images were analyzed and characterized to show the process of fouling under various solution chemistry and operational conditions. The microscopic results were further compared to the flux behaviour to evaluate its potential as a critical flux determination method.},

Since organic particles are rejected by an ‘evaporation’ mechanism, the retention time of non-volatile soluble and small organics in the submerged membrane distillation bioreactor (MDBR) is independent of the hydraulic retention time (mainly water and volatiles). A high permeate quality can be obtained in the one-step compact process. The submerged MD modules were designed for both flat-sheet membranes and tubular membrane configurations. The process performance was preliminarily evaluated by the permeate flux stabilities. The module configuration design and air sparging used in the MDBR process were tested. Flux declines were observed for the thin flat-sheet hydrophobic membranes. Tubular membrane modules provided more stable permeate fluxes probably due to the turbulent condition generated from air sparging injected inside the tubular membrane bundles. The experiments with the submerged tubular MD module gave stable fluxes of approximately 5 L/m2 h over 2 weeks at a bioreactor temperature of 56 °C. The total organic carbon in the permeate was consistently lower than 0.7 mg/L for all experiments.},

	abstract = {Treatment of wastewater from a petrochemical industry has been investigated using a novel submerged membrane distillation bioreactor (MDBR). A bench scale MDBR system with flat sheet membranes was used in the study. The testing system ran continuously (24-h) over 105 days. Membrane cleaning was conducted when the permeate flux decreased to less than 5.5L/m2h. The results showed that MDBR product quality consistently met the requirements of NEWater of Singapore except for a slightly higher total organic carbon (TOC). The membranes were found to be thermally stable, and good separation characteristics were maintained throughout the whole period of the investigation. A permeate flux of 5.5–8.6L/m2h for more than a month without membrane cleaning was achieved despite variations in the feed wastewater. The flux decline was mainly due to inorganic fouling of the membranes. Membrane permeability could be recovered by chemical cleaning. It was concluded that it was feasible to treat and reuse the wastewater using submersed MDBR technology.},

	abstract = {A novel method was proposed to quantify the scaling formation in high-concentration direct-contact membrane distillation (DCMD). The crystallization kinetics was studied using sodium chloride as a model scalant in a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) hollow-fiber module. Combined with experimental investigations, a newly established mathematical method, namely, crystallization on membrane surface (COMS) modeling, was developed and verified in terms of the membrane distillation (MD) performance and deposited crystal characteristics (median size and total number). With the experimental results of the feed concentration and DCMD performance test, the critical point of crystal deposition on the membrane surface associated with a major water flux decline was observed. On the basis of the crystal size distribution curves obtained at various operation times, the crystallization kinetic constants were determined. Combining the derived crystallization kinetic expressions with MD transport equations, the COMS modeling method was proposed to investigate the scaling formation along the operation time and quantify the critical point of a major flux decline. Correspondingly, a critical crystal size was defined and determined as 26 μm. Furthermore, a new set of experiments under different operation conditions were carried out to verify the proposed critical size method and COMS model. The small errors ({\textless}10\%) between the experimental and simulation results have confirmed the feasibility of the COMS method in quantifying the scaling process and predicting the MD performance.},

	abstract = {Separating urine from domestic wastewater promotes a more sustainable municipal wastewater treatment system. This study investigated the feasibility of applying a forward osmosis (FO) dewatering process for nutrient recovery from source-separated urine under different conditions, using seawater or desalination brine as a low-cost draw solution. The filtration process with the active layer facing feed solution exhibited relatively high water fluxes up to 20 L/m2-h. The process also revealed relatively low rejection to neutral organic nitrogen (urea-N) in fresh urine but improved rejection of ammonium (50–80\%) in hydrolyzed urine and high rejection ({\textgreater}90\%) of phosphate, potassium in most cases. Compared to simulation based on the solution–diffusion mechanism, higher water flux and solute flux were obtained using fresh or hydrolyzed urine as the feed, which was attributed to the intensive forward nutrient permeation (i.e., of urea, ammonium, and potassium). Membrane fouling could be avoided by prior removal of the spontaneously precipitated crystals in urine. Compared to other urine treatment options, the current process was cost-effective and environmentally friendly for nutrient recovery from urban wastewater at source, yet a comprehensive life-cycle impact assessment might be needed to evaluate and optimize the overall system performance at pilot and full scale operation.},

	abstract = {The recovery of ethanol from dilute aqueous solution by supported ionic liquid membrane (SILM) perstraction was investigated using three potential extracting solvent of trihexyl(tetradecyl)phosphonium ionic liquids (THTDP IL): [THTDP][Br], [THTDP][N(CN)2] and [THTDP][Tf2N], and three potential polymeric microporous membranes: polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) (hydrophilic Durapore® GVWP and hydrophobic Durapore® GVHP) and polypropylene (PP). The solvent was chosen based on hydrophobicity, thermal stability and negligible vapor pressure; while the membrane was chosen based on physicochemical properties, commercial availability and affordability. The optimized combination of solvent and membrane was assessed in a perstraction system. The [THTDP][N(CN)2]-GVHP SILM gave the best overall performance in terms of extraction and stability. At a feed concentration of 2 wt\% ethanol, the selected SILM was able to maintain its functionality for ∼240 hours without observable phase intermixing. Despite being subjected to constant lateral shear on the aqueous side, the SILM retained its integrity by maintaining a high ethanol flux of {\textgreater} 2.2 kg/m2·h (vs. ∼10-4 – 10-1 kg/m2·h in pervaporation) and selectivity of {\textgreater} 320 (vs. ∼20 in liquid-liquid extraction). Subsequently, the extracted ethanol was recovered from IL by single-stage vacuum-distillation with a final purity of 80\% (vs. ∼20\% in single-stage vacuum-distillation alone) and an overall selectivity of 200. The long-term stability, high flux and superior selectivity of the SILM perstraction system makes it a promising alternative to other energy intensive purification techniques such as distillation for the extraction of dilute ethanol as low as 2 wt\% from fermentation broths.},

	abstract = {A theoretical simulation was performed to study CO2 capture by absorption in a hollow fiber membrane contactor. Three typical alkanolamine solutions of 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP), diethanolamine (DEA) and methyldiethanoamine (MDEA) were employed as absorbents in the analysis. The effects of different sorption systems, operating conditions and membrane characteristics on the removal behavior of CO2 were investigated. Simulation results indicate that AMP and DEA solutions have much higher CO2 absorption fluxes than MDEA solution, but the concentrations of both AMP and DEA drop dramatically due to depletion. It implies that the separation efficiency and the consumption of absorbents should be taken into consideration simultaneously in terms of absorbent selection in practice applications. The liquid flow velocity, initial liquid concentration and the fiber length as well as fiber radius have significant impacts on the CO2 absorption by AMP and DEA because of their instantaneous reactions with CO2. The reaction kinetics of MDEA with CO2 has been found to be the controlling factor in the process of CO2 capture in the membrane contactor. Theoretical solution also confirms that the non-wetted mode of operation is favored, by taking the advantage of higher gas diffusivity in order to optimize CO2 capture performance.},

The effects of liquids on the membrane surface morphology and surface tension were studied by means of SEM, AFM as well as a Contact Angle Goniometer. Possible interactions between the liquids and the membranes were monitored by XPS. It was found that both Celgard X40-200 and Celgard X50-215 hollow fibers suffered changes in terms of pore structure and surface roughness after being exposed to DEA aqueous solutions. In particular, Celgard X40-200 hollow fiber membranes underwent significant deformation as observed in surface morphology during the initial stage of contact. However, dissolved CO2 was found to cause less deformation of the micro-pores and to retard surface roughening, likely due to the formation of carbamate ions from interactions between CO2 and DEA. XPS analysis suggests that possible chemical reactions between the membranes and DEA may be responsible for the alteration of the surface tension of membranes thereby reducing their hydrophobicity. Therefore, it is possible that polypropylene membranes were partially wetted during CO2 capture, leading to performance deterioration in the membrane contactor.},

	abstract = {Various pollutants of different sizes are directly (e.g., water-borne diseases) and indirectly (e.g., accumulation via trophic transfer) threatening our water health and safety. To cope with this matter, multifaceted approaches are required for advanced wastewater treatment more efficiently. Wastewater treatment using mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) could provide an excellent alternative since it could play two roles in pollutant removal by covering adsorption and size exclusion of water contaminants simultaneously. This paper provides an overview of the research progresses and trends on the emerging materials used to prepare MMMs for pollutant removal from water in the recent five years. The transition of the research trend was investigated, and the most preferred materials to prepare MMMs were weighed up based on the research trend. Various application examples where each emerging material was used have been introduced along with specific mechanisms underlying how the better performance was realized. Lastly, the perspective section addresses how to further improve the removal efficiency of pollutants in an aqueous phase, where we could find a niche to spot new materials to develop environmentally friendly MMMs, and where we could further apply MMMs.},

	abstract = {Most adsorption applications involve mixtures, yet accurate predictions of the adsorption of mixtures remain challenging, in part due to the inability to account for the interplay between adsorbate–adsorbate and adsorbate–adsorbent interactions. This study involves a comprehensive Monte Carlo simulation of the adsorption of two groups of mixtures (namely, supercritical and subcritical ones) in carbon nanopores and quantifies Henry’s constants, isotherms, energetics, and density distributions in the pores. When interadsorbate interactions are negligible (e.g., in supercritical mixtures such as mixtures of nonpolar gases), adsorbates behave like ideal gases and the adsorption isotherm can be predicted with the ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST). However, when interadsorbate interactions become significant, IAST fails. This study reveals that (1) in mixtures of polar and nonpolar gases, the stronger intermolecular interaction for the polar constituent leads to synergistic adsorption that causes the nonpolar adsorbate to desorb and (2) for mixtures of polar gases, such as ethanol and water, the adsorbate–adsorbate interactions are so dominant that the unfavorable adsorbate–adsorbent interactions are overcome, such that water adsorbs onto the hydrophobic adsorbent. The competitive and synergistic interactions highlighted here are expected to be valuable in enhancing gas separations.},
