PI: Prof Wang Rong

PRO fouling with NEWater brine significantly compromises power production due to Ca\
accumulation.\
Defect‐free 2‐inch PRO modules has been developed for pilot PRO study.\
Low pressure NF pretreatment is possible to improve the energy production in PRO by\
removing most of the Ca.\
A batch pilot PRO test to demonstrate the feasibility of pilot PRO operation where a power\
density of ~8.9 W/m2 was produced.
