Lim Yu Jie was awarded the 3rd prize for poster competition (out of 352 posters) in the 12th International Congress on Membranes and Membrane Processes (ICOM 2020 conference). ICOM is the largest and most important conference on membrane science and technology, bringing together leading membranologists and researchers to share the latest developments in this field with particular focus on emerging trends in science as well as industrial use of membranes.

Â 

ICOM conferences are organized every three years, alternating between the continents of Asia, North America and Europe. ICOM is supported by the three biggest membrane societies: the Aseanian Membrane Society (AMS), North American Membrane Society (NAMS) and European Membrane Society (EMS). Recently in 2017, ICOM was formalised by the World Association of Membrane Societies (WA-MS).
