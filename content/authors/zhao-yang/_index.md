Aquaporin proteins provide us with the way water is extracted in nature. I believe Aquaporin Inside™ Membranes (AIMs), in light of the way they mimic nature, will become a huge success in the water treatment market. Working on bringing the world's first AIM to the market is about as exciting as it gets.
