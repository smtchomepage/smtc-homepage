### Biography

Dr. Qianhong She is currently an Assistant Professor in the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering and a Principle Investigator (PI) in the Singapore Membrane Technology Centre (SMTC). Prior to the current position, he was a Lecturer in the School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at The University of Sydney, Australia (from Mar. 2017 to Jan. 2019). Between Dec 2017 and Feb 2018 he was a visiting researcher at the University of Duisburg-Essen in Germany sponsored by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF). From 2010 to 2017 he was a research associate/research fellow in the SMTC at NTU. From 2009 to 2010, he worked as an engineer at PowerChina Huadong Engineering Corporation and served as a technical consultant for a World Bank financed environment project.

 

**Awards**

• North American Membrane Society (NAMS) Young Membrane Scientist Award, 2017

• Membrane Society of Australasia (MSA) Travel Award, 2017

• Green Talent Award, by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), 2016

• Chinese Government Award for Outstanding Students Abroad, 2013

### Research Interests

Separation technologies for environmental sustainability and circular economy.

Dr She is working on the development of separation technologies to tackle pressing environmental issues, produce clean water via desalination and wastewater reclamation, separate chemical/biological products, and transform waste into value-added materials and/or clean energy. The main research interest in his group is on various membrane separation processes driven by hydraulic pressure, osmotic pressure, temperature and electrochemical potential. His group is also researching other separation processes (such as ion exchange, adsorption, extraction and distillation) and their integration with membrane separation. The objective is to improve the performance and reduce the energy consumption for separation. Currently, he is working on the following topics.

• Integrated system for energy-efficient separation

• Fundamental understanding of fouling and mass transport in separation processes

• Antifouling membrane development

### Current Projects

* A Novel Extractive Ion Exchange Membrane Contactor for Precious Metal Recovery
* Engineering Solutions Inspired by Plastics-eating Worms to End Plastic Waste
* Microbial transformation of plastics in SE Asian seas: A hazard and a solution
* Understanding of fouling mechanisms and development of fouling control strategies in ion exchange membrane processes for water and energy production
